# Kiota Form Serialization Library for Go

![Go Form Serialization](https://github.com/microsoft/kiota-serialization-form-go/actions/workflows/go.yml/badge.svg)

This is the default Kiota Go form serialization library implementation.

A [Kiota](https://github.com/microsoft/kiota) generated project will need a reference to a form serialization package to handle form payloads from an API endpoint.

Read more about Kiota [here](https://github.com/microsoft/kiota/blob/main/README.md).
