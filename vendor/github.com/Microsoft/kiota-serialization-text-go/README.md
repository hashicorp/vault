# Kiota Text Serialization Library for Go

![Go Serialization Text](https://github.com/microsoft/kiota-serialization-text-go/actions/workflows/go.yml/badge.svg)

The text Serialization Library for Go is the Go text serialization library implementation.

A [Kiota](https://github.com/microsoft/kiota) generated project will need a reference to a text serialization package to handle text payloads from an API endpoint.

Read more about Kiota [here](https://github.com/microsoft/kiota/blob/main/README.md).
