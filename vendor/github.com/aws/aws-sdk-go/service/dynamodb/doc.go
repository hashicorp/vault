// Package dynamodb provides the client and types for making API
// requests to Amazon DynamoDB.
//
// Amazon DynamoDB is a fully managed NoSQL database service that provides fast
// and predictable performance with seamless scalability. DynamoDB lets you
// offload the administrative burdens of operating and scaling a distributed
// database, so that you don't have to worry about hardware provisioning, setup
// and configuration, replication, software patching, or cluster scaling.
//
// With DynamoDB, you can create database tables that can store and retrieve
// any amount of data, and serve any level of request traffic. You can scale
// up or scale down your tables' throughput capacity without downtime or performance
// degradation, and use the Amazon Web Services Management Console to monitor
// resource utilization and performance metrics.
//
// DynamoDB automatically spreads the data and traffic for your tables over
// a sufficient number of servers to handle your throughput and storage requirements,
// while maintaining consistent and fast performance. All of your data is stored
// on solid state disks (SSDs) and automatically replicated across multiple
// Availability Zones in an Amazon Web Services Region, providing built-in high
// availability and data durability.
//
// See https://docs.aws.amazon.com/goto/WebAPI/dynamodb-2012-08-10 for more information on this service.

// See dynamodb package documentation for more information.

//
// # Using the Client
//
// To contact Amazon DynamoDB with the SDK use the New function to create
// a new service client. With that client you can make API requests to the service.
// These clients are safe to use concurrently.
//
// See the SDK's documentation for more information on how to use the SDK.
// https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-go/api/

// See aws.Config documentation for more information on configuring SDK clients.

// information on creating client for this service.
