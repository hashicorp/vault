// Package ecs provides the client and types for making API
// requests to Amazon EC2 Container Service.
//
// Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) is a highly scalable, fast,
// container management service. It makes it easy to run, stop, and manage Docker
// containers. You can host your cluster on a serverless infrastructure that's
// managed by Amazon ECS by launching your services or tasks on Fargate. For
// more control, you can host your tasks on a cluster of Amazon Elastic Compute
// Cloud (Amazon EC2) or External (on-premises) instances that you manage.
//
// Amazon ECS makes it easy to launch and stop container-based applications
// with simple API calls. This makes it easy to get the state of your cluster
// from a centralized service, and gives you access to many familiar Amazon
// EC2 features.
//
// You can use Amazon ECS to schedule the placement of containers across your
// cluster based on your resource needs, isolation policies, and availability
// requirements. With Amazon ECS, you don't need to operate your own cluster
// management and configuration management systems. You also don't need to worry
// about scaling your management infrastructure.

//
// # Using the Client
//
// To contact Amazon EC2 Container Service with the SDK use the New function to create
// a new service client. With that client you can make API requests to the service.
// These clients are safe to use concurrently.
//
// See the SDK's documentation for more information on how to use the SDK.

// See aws.Config documentation for more information on configuring SDK clients.
