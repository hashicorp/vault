// Package iam provides the client and types for making API
// requests to AWS Identity and Access Management.
//
// Identity and Access Management (IAM) is a web service for securely controlling
// access to Amazon Web Services services. With IAM, you can centrally manage
// users, security credentials such as access keys, and permissions that control
// which Amazon Web Services resources users and applications can access. For
// more information about IAM, see Identity and Access Management (IAM) (http://aws.amazon.com/iam/)
// and the Identity and Access Management User Guide (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/).
//
// See https://docs.aws.amazon.com/goto/WebAPI/iam-2010-05-08 for more information on this service.
//
// See iam package documentation for more information.

//
// # Using the Client
//
// To contact AWS Identity and Access Management with the SDK use the New function to create
// a new service client. With that client you can make API requests to the service.
// These clients are safe to use concurrently.
//
// See the SDK's documentation for more information on how to use the SDK.
// https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-go/api/
//
// See aws.Config documentation for more information on configuring SDK clients.

// See the AWS Identity and Access Management client IAM for more
// information on creating client for this service.
