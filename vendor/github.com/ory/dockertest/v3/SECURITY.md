# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We release patches for security vulnerabilities. Which versions are eligible for
receiving such patches depends on the CVSS v3.0 Rating:

| CVSS v3.0 | Supported Versions                        |
| --------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| 9.0-10.0  | Releases within the previous three months |
| 4.0-8.9   | Most recent release                       |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please report (suspected) security vulnerabilities to
**[security@ory.sh](mailto:security@ory.sh)**. You will receive a response from
us within 48 hours. If the issue is confirmed, we will release a patch as soon
as possible depending on complexity but historically within a few days.
