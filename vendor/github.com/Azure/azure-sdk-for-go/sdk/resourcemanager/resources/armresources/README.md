# Azure Resources Module for Go

[![PkgGoDev](https://pkg.go.dev/badge/github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-go/sdk/resourcemanager/resources/armresources)](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-go/sdk/resourcemanager/resources/armresources)

The `armresources` module provides operations for working with Azure Resources.

[Source code](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-go/tree/main/sdk/resourcemanager/resources/armresources)

# Getting started

## Prerequisites

- an [Azure subscription](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/)
- Go 1.18 or above (You could download and install the latest version of Go from [here](https://go.dev/doc/install). It will replace the existing Go on your machine. If you want to install multiple Go versions on the same machine, you could refer this [doc](https://go.dev/doc/manage-install).)

## Install the package

This project uses [Go modules](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/Modules) for versioning and dependency management.

Install the Azure Resources module:

```sh
go get github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-go/sdk/resourcemanager/resources/armresources
```

## Authorization

When creating a client, you will need to provide a credential for authenticating with Azure Resources.  The `azidentity` module provides facilities for various ways of authenticating with Azure including client/secret, certificate, managed identity, and more.

```go
cred, err := azidentity.NewDefaultAzureCredential(nil)
```

For more information on authentication, please see the documentation for `azidentity` at [pkg.go.dev/github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-go/sdk/azidentity](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-go/sdk/azidentity).

## Client Factory

Azure Resources module consists of one or more clients. We provide a client factory which could be used to create any client in this module.

```go
clientFactory, err := armresources.NewClientFactory(<subscription ID>, cred, nil)
```

You can use `ClientOptions` in package `github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-go/sdk/azcore/arm` to set endpoint to connect with public and sovereign clouds as well as Azure Stack. For more information, please see the documentation for `azcore` at [pkg.go.dev/github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-go/sdk/azcore](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-go/sdk/azcore).

```go
options := arm.ClientOptions {
    ClientOptions: azcore.ClientOptions {
        Cloud: cloud.AzureChina,
    },
}
clientFactory, err := armresources.NewClientFactory(<subscription ID>, cred, &options)
```

## Clients

A client groups a set of related APIs, providing access to its functionality.  Create one or more clients to access the APIs you require using client factory.

```go
client := clientFactory.NewClient()
```

## Fakes

The fake package contains types used for constructing in-memory fake servers used in unit tests.
This allows writing tests to cover various success/error conditions without the need for connecting to a live service.

Please see https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-go/tree/main/sdk/samples/fakes for details and examples on how to use fakes.
