# The rulez

There's a couple. They're not even really rules, more just telling you what you
can expect.

* Issues are ALWAYS welcome, whether or not you think it's a dumb question or
  it's been asked before. I make a very real attempt to respond to all issues in
  24 hours. You can email me directly if I don't make this deadline.

* Please always preface a pull request by making an issue. It can save you some
  time if it turns out that something you consider an issue is actually intended
  behavior, and saves me the difficult task of telling you that I'm going to let
  the work you put in go to waste.

* The API never breaks. All PRs which aren't backwards compatible will not be
  accepted. Similarly, if I do commit something which isn't backwards compatible
  with an older behavior please submit an issue ASAP so I can fix it.
