# Contributing

If you would like to contribute code to go-jose you can do so through GitHub by
forking the repository and sending a pull request.

When submitting code, please make every effort to follow existing conventions
and style in order to keep the code as readable as possible. Please also make
sure all tests pass by running `go test`, and format your code with `go fmt`.
We also recommend using `golint` and `errcheck`.

Before your code can be accepted into the project you must also sign the
Individual Contributor License Agreement.  We use [cla-assistant.io][1] and you
will be prompted to sign once a pull request is opened.
