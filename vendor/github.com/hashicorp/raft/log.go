If an implementation can't tolerate this it may optionally implement `MonotonicLogStore` to indicate that this is not allowed.

// snapshot is restored. The LogStore must have an efficient implementation of
// DeleteLogs for the case where all logs are removed, as this must be called after snapshot restore when gaps are not allowed.
