# net-rpc-msgpackrpc

This library provides the same functions as `net/rpc/jsonrpc` but for
communicating with [MessagePack](http://msgpack.org/) instead. The library
is modeled directly after the Go standard library so it should be easy to
use and obvious.

See the [GoDoc](http://godoc.org/github.com/hashicorp/net-rpc-msgpackrpc) for
API documentation.
