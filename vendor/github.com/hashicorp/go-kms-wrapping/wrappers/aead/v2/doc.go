/*

This package contains only aliases to the types and functions in
github.com/hashicorp/go-kms-wrapping/v2/aead. The purpose is to make it a bit
more intuitive for users of the library to make use of the AEAD wrapper since it
has a different import path.

It is preferred to use the base package directly, but this package can be used
if it is useful and desired.
