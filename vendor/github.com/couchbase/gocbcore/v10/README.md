# Couchbase Go Core

This package provides the underlying Couchbase IO for the gocb project.
If you are looking for the Couchbase Go SDK, you are probably looking for
[gocb](https://github.com/couchbase/gocb).


## Branching Strategy
The gocbcore library maintains a branch for each previous major revision 
of its API. These branches are introduced just prior to any API breaking
changes.  Active work is performed on the master branch, with releases
being performed as tags. Work made on master which are not yet part of a
tagged released should be considered liable to change.
