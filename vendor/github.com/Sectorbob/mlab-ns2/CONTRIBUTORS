# This is the official list of people who can contribute
# (and typically have contributed) code to the mlab-ns2
# repository.
#
# Names should be added to this file like so:
#     Name <email address>
#
# An entry with two email addresses specifies that the
# first address should be used in the submit logs and
# that the second address should be recognized as the
# same person when interacting with Rietveld.

# Please keep the list sorted.
