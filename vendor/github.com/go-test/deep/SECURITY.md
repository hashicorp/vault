## Reporting a Vulnerability

To report a vulnerability, [create an issue](https://github.com/go-test/deep/issues) with the _security_ label.

This project is developed and maintained by volunteers during their free time,
so there is no SLA or ETA for fixing vulnerabilities (or any issues).
Please help by submitting a PR to fix an issue.
