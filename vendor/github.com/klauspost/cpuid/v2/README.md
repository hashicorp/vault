# cpuid
Package cpuid provides information about the CPU running the current program.

CPU features are detected on startup, and kept for fast access through the life of the application.
Currently x86 / x64 (AMD64/i386) and ARM (ARM64) is supported, and no external C (cgo) code is used, which should make the library very easy to use.

You can access the CPU information by accessing the shared CPU variable of the cpuid library.

## installing

`go get -u github.com/klauspost/cpuid/v2` using modules.
Drop `v2` for others.

Installing binary:

`go install github.com/klauspost/cpuid/v2/cmd/cpuid@latest`

Or download binaries from release page: https://github.com/klauspost/cpuid/releases

### Homebrew

For macOS/Linux users, you can install via [brew](https://brew.sh/)

```sh
$ brew install cpuid
```

## example

```Go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"strings"

	. "github.com/klauspost/cpuid/v2"
)

func main() {
	// Print basic CPU information:
	fmt.Println("Name:", CPU.BrandName)
	fmt.Println("PhysicalCores:", CPU.PhysicalCores)
	fmt.Println("ThreadsPerCore:", CPU.ThreadsPerCore)
	fmt.Println("LogicalCores:", CPU.LogicalCores)
	fmt.Println("Family", CPU.Family, "Model:", CPU.Model, "Vendor ID:", CPU.VendorID)
	fmt.Println("Features:", strings.Join(CPU.FeatureSet(), ","))
	fmt.Println("Cacheline bytes:", CPU.CacheLine)
	fmt.Println("L1 Data Cache:", CPU.Cache.L1D, "bytes")
	fmt.Println("L1 Instruction Cache:", CPU.Cache.L1I, "bytes")
	fmt.Println("L2 Cache:", CPU.Cache.L2, "bytes")
	fmt.Println("L3 Cache:", CPU.Cache.L3, "bytes")
	fmt.Println("Frequency", CPU.Hz, "hz")

	// Test if we have these specific features:
	if CPU.Supports(SSE, SSE2) {
		fmt.Println("We have Streaming SIMD 2 Extensions")
	}
}
```

# usage

The `cpuid.CPU` provides access to CPU features. Use `cpuid.CPU.Supports()` to check for CPU features.
A faster `cpuid.CPU.Has()` is provided which will usually be inlined by the gc compiler.  

To test a larger number of features, they can be combined using `f := CombineFeatures(CMOV, CMPXCHG8, X87, FXSR, MMX, SYSCALL, SSE, SSE2)`, etc.
This can be using with `cpuid.CPU.HasAll(f)` to quickly test if all features are supported.

Note that for some cpu/os combinations some features will not be detected.
`amd64` has rather good support and should work reliably on all platforms.

Note that hypervisors may not pass through all CPU features through to the guest OS,
so even if your host supports a feature it may not be visible on guests.

## arm64 feature detection

Not all operating systems provide ARM features directly 
and there is no safe way to do so for the rest.

Currently `arm64/linux` and `arm64/freebsd` should be quite reliable. 
`arm64/darwin` adds features expected from the M1 processor, but a lot remains undetected.

A `DetectARM()` can be used if you are able to control your deployment,
it will detect CPU features, but may crash if the OS doesn't intercept the calls.
A `-cpu.arm` flag for detecting unsafe ARM features can be added. See below.
 
Note that currently only features are detected on ARM, 
no additional information is currently available. 

## flags

It is possible to add flags that affects cpu detection.

For this the `Flags()` command is provided.

This must be called *before* `flag.Parse()` AND after the flags have been parsed `Detect()` must be called.

This means that any detection used in `init()` functions will not contain these flags.

Example:

```Go
package main

import (
	"flag"
	"fmt"
	"strings"

	"github.com/klauspost/cpuid/v2"
)

func main() {
	cpuid.Flags()
	flag.Parse()
	cpuid.Detect()

	// Test if we have these specific features:
	if cpuid.CPU.Supports(cpuid.SSE, cpuid.SSE2) {
		fmt.Println("We have Streaming SIMD 2 Extensions")
	}
}
```
