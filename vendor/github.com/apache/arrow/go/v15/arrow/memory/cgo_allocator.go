// CgoArrowAllocator is an allocator which exposes the C++ memory pool class
// from the Arrow C++ Library as an allocator for memory buffers to use in Go.
// The build tag 'ccalloc' must be used in order to include it as it requires
// linking against the arrow library.
//
// The primary reason to use this would be as an allocator when dealing with
// exporting data across the cdata interface in order to ensure that the memory
// is allocated safely on the C side so it can be held on the CGO side beyond
// the context of a single function call. If the memory in use isn't allocated
// on the C side, then it is not safe for any pointers to data to be held outside
// of Go beyond the context of a single Cgo function call as it will be invisible
// to the Go garbage collector and could potentially get moved without being updated.
//
// As an alternative, if the arrow C++ libraries aren't available, remember that
// Allocator is an interface, so anything which can allocate data using C/C++ can
// be exposed and then used to meet the Allocator interface if wanting to export data
// across the Cgo interfaces.

// small allocations can end up being expensive and potentially slower than just using
// go memory. This means that preallocating via reserve becomes much more important when
// using this allocator.
//
// Future development TODO: look into converting this more into a slab style allocator
// which amortizes the cost of smaller allocations by allocating bigger chunks of memory
// and passes them out.

//
// A finalizer is set on the allocator so when the allocator object itself is eventually
// cleaned up by the garbage collector, it will delete the associated C++ memory pool

// for every time memory is allocated, freed or reallocated.
