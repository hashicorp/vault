// in two respects:
//
//   - The caller provides the root directory as an *[os.File] (preferably O_PATH)
//     handle. This means that the caller can be sure which root directory is
//     being used. Note that this can be emulated by using /proc/self/fd/... as
//     the root path with [os.MkdirAll].
//
//   - Once all of the directories have been created, an *[os.File] O_PATH handle
//     to the directory at unsafePath is returned to the caller. This is done in
//     an effectively-race-free way (an attacker would only be able to swap the
//     final directory component), which is not possible to emulate with
//     [MkdirAll].
//
// In addition, the returned handle is obtained far more efficiently than doing
// a brand new lookup of unsafePath (such as with [SecureJoin] or openat2) after
// doing [MkdirAll]. If you intend to open the directory after creating it, you
// should use MkdirAllHandle.
