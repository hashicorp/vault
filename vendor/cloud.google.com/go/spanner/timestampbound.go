// TimestampBound defines how Cloud Spanner will choose a timestamp for a single
// read/query or read-only transaction.
//
// There are three types of timestamp bound: strong, bounded staleness and exact
// staleness. Strong is the default.
//
// If the Cloud Spanner database to be read is geographically distributed, stale
// read-only transactions can execute more quickly than strong or read-write
// transactions, because they are able to execute far from the leader replica.
//
// Each type of timestamp bound is discussed in detail below.  A TimestampBound
// can be specified when creating transactions, see the documentation of
// spanner.Client for an example.
//
// # Strong reads
//
// Strong reads are guaranteed to see the effects of all transactions that have
// committed before the start of the read. Furthermore, all rows yielded by a
// single read are consistent with each other: if any part of the read
// observes a transaction, all parts of the read see the transaction.
//
// Strong reads are not repeatable: two consecutive strong read-only
// transactions might return inconsistent results if there are concurrent
// writes. If consistency across reads is required, the reads should be
// executed within a transaction or at an exact read timestamp.
//
// Use StrongRead to create a bound of this type.
//
// # Exact staleness
//
// An exact staleness timestamp bound executes reads at a user-specified
// timestamp. Reads at a timestamp are guaranteed to see a consistent prefix of
// the global transaction history: they observe modifications done by all
// transactions with a commit timestamp less than or equal to the read
// timestamp, and observe none of the modifications done by transactions with a
// larger commit timestamp. They will block until all conflicting transactions
// that may be assigned commit timestamps less than or equal to the read
// timestamp have finished.
//
// The timestamp can either be expressed as an absolute Cloud Spanner commit
// timestamp or a staleness relative to the current time.
//
// These modes do not require a "negotiation phase" to pick a timestamp. As a
// result, they execute slightly faster than the equivalent boundedly stale
// concurrency modes. On the other hand, boundedly stale reads usually return
// fresher results.
//
// Use ReadTimestamp and ExactStaleness to create a bound of this type.
//
// # Bounded staleness
//
// Bounded staleness modes allow Cloud Spanner to pick the read timestamp,
// subject to a user-provided staleness bound. Cloud Spanner chooses the newest
// timestamp within the staleness bound that allows execution of the reads at
// the closest available replica without blocking.
//
// All rows yielded are consistent with each other: if any part of the read
// observes a transaction, all parts of the read see the transaction. Boundedly
// stale reads are not repeatable: two stale reads, even if they use the same
// staleness bound, can execute at different timestamps and thus return
// inconsistent results.
//
// Boundedly stale reads execute in two phases. The first phase negotiates a
// timestamp among all replicas needed to serve the read. In the second phase,
// reads are executed at the negotiated timestamp.
//
// As a result of this two-phase execution, bounded staleness reads are usually
// a little slower than comparable exact staleness reads. However, they are
// typically able to return fresher results, and are more likely to execute at
// the closest replica.
//
// Because the timestamp negotiation requires up-front knowledge of which rows
// will be read, it can only be used with single-use reads and single-use
// read-only transactions.
//
// Use MinReadTimestamp and MaxStaleness to create a bound of this type.
//
// # Old read timestamps and garbage collection
//
// Cloud Spanner continuously garbage collects deleted and overwritten data in
// the background to reclaim storage space. This process is known as "version
// GC". By default, version GC reclaims versions after they are one hour old.
// Because of this, Cloud Spanner cannot perform reads at read timestamps more
// than one hour in the past. This restriction also applies to in-progress reads
// and/or SQL queries whose timestamps become too old while executing. Reads and
// SQL queries with too-old read timestamps fail with the error
// ErrorCode.FAILED_PRECONDITION.
