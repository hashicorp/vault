```release-note:improvement
secrets-sync (enterprise): Added support for a boolean force_delete flag (default: false).
When set to true, this flag allows deletion of a destination even if its associations cannot be unsynced.
This option should be used only as a last-resort deletion mechanism, as any secrets already synced to the external provider will remain orphaned and require manual cleanup.
