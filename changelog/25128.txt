```release-note:change
plugins: By default, environment variables provided during plugin registration will now take precedence over system environment variables.
Use the environment variable `VAULT_PLUGIN_USE_LEGACY_ENV_LAYERING=true` to opt out and keep higher preference for system environment
variables. When this flag is set, Vault will check during unseal for conflicts and print warnings for any plugins with environment
variables that conflict with system environment variables.
```
