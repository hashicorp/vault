```release-note:feature
**Login MFA TOTP Self-Enrollment (Enterprise)**: Simplify creation of login MFA TOTP credentials for users, allowing them to self-enroll MFA TOTP using a QR code (TOTP secret) generated during login. The new functionality is configurable on the TOTP login MFA method configuration screen and via the `enable_self_enrollment` parameter in the API.
