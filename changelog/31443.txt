```release-note:bug
raft/autopilot: Fixes an issue with enterprise redundancy zones where, if the leader was in a redundancy zone and that leader becomes unavailable, the node would become an unzoned voter. This can artificially inflate the required number of nodes for quorum, leading to a situation where the cluster cannot recover if another leader subsequently becomes unavailable. Vault will now keep an unavailable node in its last known redundancy zone as a non-voter.
