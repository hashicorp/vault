# changelog

This folder holds changelog updates from commit 3bc7d15 onwards.

Release notes are text files with three lines:

 1. An opening code block with the `release-note:<MODE>` type annotation.

    For example:

        ```release-note:bug

    Valid modes are:

     - `bug` - Any sort of non-security defect fix. 
     - `change` - A change in the product that may require action or
       review by the operator. Examples would be any kind of API change
       (as opposed to backwards compatible addition), a notable behavior
       change, or anything that might require attention before updating. Go
       version changes are also listed here since they can potentially have
       large, sometimes unknown impacts. (Go updates are a special case, and
       dep updates in general aren't a `change`). Discussion of any potential
       `change` items in the pull request to see what other communication
       might be warranted.
     - `deprecation` - Announcement of a planned future removal of a
       feature. Only use this if a deprecation notice also exists [in the
       docs](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/docs/deprecation).
     - `feature` - Large topical additions for a major release. These are
       rarely in minor releases. Formatting for `feature` entries differs
       from normal changelog formatting - see the [new features
       instructions](#new-and-major-features).
     - `improvement` - Most updates to the product that arenâ€™t `bug`s, but
       aren't big enough to be a `feature`, will be an `improvement`.

 2. A component (for example, `secret/pki` or `sdk/framework` or), a colon and a space, and then a one-line description of the change.

 3. An ending code block.

If more than one area is impacted, use separate code blocks for each entry.

This should be in a file named after the pull request number (e.g., `12345.txt`).

There are many examples in this folder; check one out if you're stuck!

See [hashicorp/go-changelog](https://github.com/hashicorp/go-changelog) for full documentation on the supported entries.

## New and Major Features

For features we are introducing in a new major release, we prefer a single
changelog entry representing that feature. This way, it is clear to readers
what feature is being introduced. You do not need to reference a specific PR,
and the formatting is slightly different - your changelog file should look
like:

    changelog/<pr num OR feature name>.txt:
    ```release-note:feature
    **Feature Name**: Description of feature - for example "Custom password policies are now supported for all database engines."
    ```
