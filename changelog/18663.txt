```release-note:improvement
openapi: generic_mount_paths: Move implementation fully into server, rather than partially in plugin framework; recognize all 4 singleton mounts (auth/token, cubbyhole, identity, system) rather than just 2; change parameter from `{mountPath}` to `{<type>_mount_path}`
```
