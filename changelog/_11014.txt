```release-note:bug
secrets-sync (enterprise): Corrected a bug where the deletion of the latest KV-V2 secret version caused the associated external secret
to be deleted entirely. The sync job now implements a version fallback mechanism to find and sync the highest available
active version, ensuring continuity and preventing the unintended deletion of the external secret resource.
