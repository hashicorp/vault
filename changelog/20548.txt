```release-note:feature
**Vault Proxy**: Introduced Vault Proxy, a new subcommand of the Vault binary that can be invoked using `vault proxy -config=config.hcl`. It currently has the same feature set as Vault Agent's API proxy, but the two may diverge in the future. We plan to deprecate the API proxy functionality of Vault Agent in a future release.
