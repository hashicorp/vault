```release-note:bug
storage/consul: fix a bug where an active node in a specific sort of network
partition could continue to write data to Consul after a new leader is elected
potentially causing data loss or corruption for keys with many concurrent
writers. For Enterprise clusters this could cause corruption of the merkle trees
leading to failure to complete merkle sync without a full re-index.
```
