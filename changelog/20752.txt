```release-note:feature
**Vault PKI ACME Server**: Support for the ACME certificate lifecycle management protocol has been added to the Vault PKI Plugin. This allows standard ACME clients, such as the EFF's certbot and the CNCF's k8s cert-manager, to request certificates from a Vault server with no knowledge of Vault APIs or authentication mechanisms. For public-facing Vault instances, we recommend requiring External Account Bindings (EAB) to limit the ability to request certificates to only authenticated clients.
