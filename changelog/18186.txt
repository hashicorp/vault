```release-note:breaking-change
secrets/pki: Maintaining running count of certificates will be turned off by default.
To re-enable keeping these metrics available on the tidy status endpoint, enable
maintain_stored_certificate_counts on tidy-config, to also publish them to the
metrics consumer, enable publish_stored_certificate_count_metrics .
