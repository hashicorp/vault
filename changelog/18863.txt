```release-note:improvement
agent: JWT auto-auth has a new config option, `remove_jwt_follows_symlinks` (default: false), that, if set to true will now remove the JWT, instead of the symlink to the JWT, if a symlink to a JWT has been provided in the `path` option, and the `remove_jwt_after_reading` config option is set to true (default).
