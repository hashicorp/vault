```release-note:improvement
secrets/pki: Complete the set of name constraints parameters by adding permitted_email_addresses, permitted_ip_ranges, permitted_uri_domains, excluded_dns_domains, excluded_email_addresses, excluded_ip_ranges, and excluded_uri_domains; this makes it possible for the name constraints extension to be fully specified when creating root and intermediate CA certificates.
