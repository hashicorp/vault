```release-note:deprecation
core: disallow usage of duplicate attributes in HCL configuration files and policy definitions, which were already
deprecated. For now those errors can be suppressed back to warnings by setting the environment variable
VAULT_ALLOW_PENDING_REMOVAL_DUPLICATE_HCL_ATTRIBUTES.
