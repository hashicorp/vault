```release-note:feature
**Environment Variables through Vault Agent**: Introducing a new process-supervisor mode for Vault Agent which allows injecting secrets as environment variables into a child process using a new `env_template` configuration stanza. The process-supervisor configuration can be generated with a new `vault agent generate-config` helper tool.
