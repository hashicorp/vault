```changelog:change
aws/auth: AWS Auth concepts and endpoints that use the "whitelist" and "blacklist" terms
have been updated to more inclusive language (e.g. `/auth/aws/identity-whitelist` has been
updated to`/auth/aws/identity-accesslist`). The legacy endpoint names have not been removed
but are considered **deprecated**. The old and new endpoints are essentially aliases, sharing
the same underlying data. The complete list of endpoint changes is available in the
[AWS Auth API docs](https://www.vaultproject.io/api-docs/auth/aws).
```

```changelog:deprecation
aws/auth: AWS Auth endpoints that use the "whitelist" and "blacklist" terms have been deprecated.
Refer to the CHANGES section for addition details.
