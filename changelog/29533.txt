```release-note:improvement
api: Remove dependency on module go-rootcerts. That module
provided a workaround to load system root certificates on MacOS, but that
workaround is not needed anymore since Go 1.15. Also that module is unmaintained
and this removal reduces the dependency chain of downstream projects.
