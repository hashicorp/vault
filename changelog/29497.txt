```release-note:feature
**Automated Root Rotation**: Adds Automated Root Rotation capabilities to the AWS Auth and AWS Secrets
plugins. This allows plugin users to automate their root credential rotations based on configurable
schedules/periods via the Rotation Manager. Note: Enterprise only.
```
```release-note:change
secrets/aws: The AWS Secrets engine now persists entries to storage between writes. This enables users
to not have to pass every required field on each write and to make individual updates as necessary.
Note: in order to zero out a value that is previously configured, users must now explicitly set the
field to its zero value on an update.
