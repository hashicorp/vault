The Vault docs now live in the
[`hashicorp/web-unified-docs`](https://github.com/hashicorp/web-unified-docs)
repo under `/content/vault/`.

You can still contribute to Vault docs by created a PR under
`hashicorp/web-unified-docs`:

- For content changes related to the monthly Vault update, submit PRs against
  the monthly update branch (e.g., `vault/202509`).

- For content changes related to an upcoming Vault release, submit PRs against
  the RC release branch (e.g., `vault/1.21.x`).

- For version-agnostic updates like typos, corrections, and broken links, submit
  PRs against the `main` branch.
