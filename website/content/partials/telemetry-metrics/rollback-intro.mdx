By default, Vault does not separate rollback metrics by mountpoint. To enable
explictly named metrics for mountpoints, enable the
[`add_mount_point_rollback_metrics`](/vault/docs/configuration/telemetry#add_mount_point_rollback_metrics)
option in your `telemetry` configuration stanza.

If you enable named metrics for mountpoints, the metric name converts forward
slashes (`/`) in mount names to dashes (`-`). For example, if you have the
`auth/token` backend configured and mountpoint names enabled for telemetry,
the corresponding mount point metric string is `auth-token`.
