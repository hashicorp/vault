Mount-specific route metrics for each configured mount point. Metric names
convert forward slashes (`/`) in mount names to dashes (`-`). For example, if
you have the `auth/token` backend configured, the corresponding mount point
metric string is `auth-token`

By default, Vault does not separate rollback metrics by mountpoint. To enable
explictly named metrics for mountpoints, enable the
[`add_mount_point_rollback_metrics`](/vault/docs/configuration/telemetry#add_mount_point_rollback_metrics)
option in your `telemetry` configuration stanza.
