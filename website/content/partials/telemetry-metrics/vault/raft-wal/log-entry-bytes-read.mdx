### vault.raft.wal.log-entry-bytes-read ((#vault-raft-wal-log-entry-bytes-read))

</Warning>

Metric type | Value   | Description
----------- | ------- | -----------
counter     | number  | Number of bytes of log entries read from segments before decoding.

The `log-entry-bytes-read` counter is technically an overestimate because it
includes bytes from headers, index entries, and secondary reads for entries
too large to fit in buffers.
