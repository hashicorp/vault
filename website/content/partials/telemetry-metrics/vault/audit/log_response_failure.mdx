| counter     | number | The number of audit log response failures across all devices                              |

The number of response failures is a **crucial metric**.

When using Prometheus sink use `rate` or `irate` to convert this into the number
of failures over a specific time period.

When using Vault's built-in `/metrics` output format, counters are reported
aggregated over the metrics interval which defaults to 10 seconds. Due to
historical reasons, this counter is recorded in a way that makes the `count`
field misleading - it counts every request whether it failed or not. The `mean`
value however will correctly record the normalized per-second rate at which
audit errors have occurred over the interval.

Any increase in this counter indicates that all the configured audit devices
failed to log a request (or response). If Vault cannot properly audit a request,
or the response to a request, the original request will fail.

Refer to the Vault logs and any device-specific metrics to troubleshoot the
failing audit log device.
