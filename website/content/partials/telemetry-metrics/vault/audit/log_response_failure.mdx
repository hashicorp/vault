| counter     | number | Number of audit log request failures across all devices |

The number of request failures is a **crucial metric**.

A non-zero value for `vault.audit.log_response_failure` indicates that one of
the configured audit log devices failed to respond to Vault. If Vault cannot
properly audit a request, or the response to a request, the original request
will fail.

Refer to the device-specific metrics and logs to troubleshoot the failing audit
log device.
