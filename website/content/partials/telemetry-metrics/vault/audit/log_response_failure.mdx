### vault.audit.log_response_failure ((#vault-audit-log_response_failure))

| Metric type | Value  | Description                                                                                |

| gauge       | number | Average (mean) number of audit log response failures across all devices during time period |

The number of request failures is a **crucial metric**.

A non-zero value for `vault.audit.log_response_failure` indicates that all
the configured audit log devices failed to log a response to a request. If Vault cannot
properly audit a request, or the response to a request, the original request
will fail.

The `mean` value for this metric should be monitored, not the `count` which could be misleading.

Refer to the device-specific metrics and logs to troubleshoot the failing audit
log device.
