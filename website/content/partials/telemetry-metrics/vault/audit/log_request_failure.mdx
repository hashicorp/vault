### vault.audit.log_request_failure ((#vault-audit-log_request_failure))

| Metric type | Value  | Description                                                                               |

| gauge       | number | Average (mean) number of audit log request failures across all devices during time period |

The number of request failures is a **crucial metric**.

A non-zero value for `vault.audit.log_request_failure` indicates that all
the configured audit devices failed to log a request (or response). If Vault cannot
properly audit a request, or the response to a request, the original request
will fail.

The `mean` value for this metric should be monitored, not the `count` which could be misleading.

Refer to the Vault logs and any device-specific metrics to troubleshoot the
failing audit log device.
