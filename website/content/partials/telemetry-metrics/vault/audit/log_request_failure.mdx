### vault.audit.log_request_failure ((#vault-audit-log_request_failure))

Metric type | Value   | Description
----------- | ------- | -----------
counter     | number  | Number of audit log request failures across all devices

The number of request failures is a **crucial metric**.

A non-zero value for `vault.audit.log_request_failure` indicates that all your
configured audit devices failed to log a request (or response). If Vault cannot
properly audit a request, or the response to a request, the original request
will fail.

Refer to the Vault logs and any device-specific metrics to troubleshoot the
failing audit log device.
