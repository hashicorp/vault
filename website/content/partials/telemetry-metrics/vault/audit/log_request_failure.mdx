| counter     | number | Number of audit log request failures across all devices |

The number of request failures is a **crucial metric**.

A non-zero value for `vault.audit.log_request_failure` indicates that all your
configured audit devices failed to log a request (or response). If Vault cannot
properly audit a request, or the response to a request, the original request
will fail.

Refer to the Vault logs and any device-specific metrics to troubleshoot the
failing audit log device.
