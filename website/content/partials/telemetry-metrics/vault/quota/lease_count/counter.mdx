### vault.quota.lease_count.counter ((#vault-quota-lease_count-counter))

Metric type | Value | Description
----------- | ----- | -----------
gauge       | lease | Total number of leases associated with the named quota rule

The number of leases reported is specific to the quota rule listed in the `name`
label, not the number of leases in general. For example, if the named rule
allows for 50 leases max and there are currently 40 leases in the scope of that
quota rule, the value of `vault.quota.lease_count.counter` is 40 even if there
are 1000 other leases that are unscoped or in the scope of other quota rules.
