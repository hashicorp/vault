~> **Compatibility information:** As of Consul 1.14.0, Consul on Kubernetes uses [Consul Dataplane](/consul/docs/connect/dataplane) by default instead of client agents. Vault does not currently support Consul Dataplane. Please follow the Consul 1.14.0 [upgrade guide](/consul/docs/k8s/upgrade#upgrading-to-consul-dataplane) to ensure that your Consul on Kubernetes deployment continues to use client agents.
