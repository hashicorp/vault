**`VAULT_PROXY_ADDR (string : "")`**

The HTTPS or HTTP address, including server and port, where clients can access
Vault. Setting `VAULT_HTTP_PROXY` overrides the default proxy resolution
behavior and tells Vault to ignore the following proxy-related environment
variables: `HTTP_PROXY`, `HTTPS_PROXY`, and `NO_PROXY`.

**Preferred over `VAULT_HTTP_ADDR`**.

All CLI requests resolve the specified proxy and you cannot exclude domains from
consulting the proxy server.

**Example**: `export VAULT_PROXY_ADDR="https://gohereforvault:8200"`
