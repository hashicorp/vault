**`VAULT_SRV_LOOKUP (bool : false)`**

Use SRV records instead of standard DNS to look up hostnames as described in
the Network Working Group draft
["Use of SRV records in conjunction with HTTP and URIs"](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-andrews-http-srv-02).

**Example**: `export VAULT_SRV_LOOKUP=1`

<Warning title="Not appropriate for production">

  SRV lookup is still in discovery and not designed for high-availability
  deployments.
