**`key (string : <required>)`**

The key material to import, encoded in base64 format. For symmetric keys like 
AES, this is the raw key material. For asymmetric keys like RSA, this is the 
DER-encoded format. If the value starts with `@`, it is treated as a path to a 
file containing the key material.

**Example**: `@/path/to/key`
