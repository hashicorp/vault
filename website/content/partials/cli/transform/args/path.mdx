**`path (string : <required>)`**

The path to the transform key to import, formatted as `<mount>/keys/<key-name>`. 
This path consists of two parts: `<mount>`, which is the path to the mount, and
`<key-name>`, which is the desired name of the key. You can optionally specify a
namespace in the `<mount>` path using the `-namespace=<ns>` flag.

**Example**: `transform/keys/my-key`
