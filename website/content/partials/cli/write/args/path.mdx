**`path (string : <required>)`**

The path to the key to write. The data can be credentials, secrets, 
configuration, or arbitrary data. The specific behavior of the `write` 
command is determined at the thing mounted at the path.

This path consists of two parts: `<mount>`, which is the path to the mount, and 
`<key-name>`, which is the desired name of the key. You can optionally specify a 
namespace in the `<mount>` path using the `-namespace=<ns>` flag.

**Example**: `auth/token/create`, `cubbyhole/git-credentials`, 
`transit/keys/my-key`, `aws/roles/ops`
