**`secret_path (string : <required>)`**

Path to the key/value secret.

<Note>

If you omit the `-mount` flag, Vault interprets the secret path as a combination
of the mount path **and** secret path. For `kv` v2 plugins, Vault automatically
tries to inject the `/data/` path segment appropriately when `-mount` is unset.

**Example**: `dev/seeds`
