**`-cas (int : -1)`**

Specifies the value to use for the Check-And-Set operation. If set to 0 or not
set, the patch will be allowed. 

This flag will only be used for the `patch` method. This flag is required if
`cas_required` is set to `true` on either the secret or the engine's config. If
the index is non-zero, the patch will only be allowed if the key's current
version matches the version specified in the `-cas` parameter.

This flag will be ignored for the `rw` method. Instead, its value will be
derived from fetching the current version of the secret.

**Example**: `-cas 1`
