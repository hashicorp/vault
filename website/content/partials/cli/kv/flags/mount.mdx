**`-mount (string : "")`**

Specifies the path where the KV backend is mounted. If specified, the next 
argument will be interpreted as the secret path. If this flag is not specified, 
the next argument will be interpreted as the combined mount path and secret 
path, with `/data/` automatically inserted for KV v2 secrets.

**Example**: `-mount "secret"`
