**`type (string : "internal")`**

This determines the type of key use for the newly created certificate. Valid 
types are:

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `existing` | Links to a key that already exists in the Vault backend |
| `internal` | Generates a new key pair within Vault for this certificate |
| `kms` | Links to an external key management system (KMS). You cannot use exported keys |

<Note>

When using an existing key, the key must be present in the same mount where 
you are generating the new certificate. The command will fail if you specify a 
template from a different mount with type `existing` without providing a valid 
`key_ref` that exists in the target mount.

</Note>

**Example**: `-type= "existing"`
