- `permission`: Exit with non-zero code if the tool lacks permissions or has a version 
  mismatch with the server
- `critical`: Exit with non-zero code for critical status checks and permission issues
- `warning`: Exit with non-zero code for warning status checks and above conditions
- `informational`: Exit with non-zero code for informational status checks and above conditions  
- `default`: Use default behavior based on message severity - only return zero exit status
  when all checks pass and no execution errors occur
