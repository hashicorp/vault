**`-host-key-mount-point (string : "")`**

Mount point to the SSH secrets engine where host keys are signed. When given a
value, Vault will generate a custom `known_hosts` file with delegation to the
CA at the provided mount point to verify the SSH connection's host keys against
the provided CA. By default, host keys are validated against the user's local
"known_hosts" file. This flag forces strict key host checking and ignores a
custom user known hosts file. You can also specify this via the
`VAULT_SSH_HOST_KEY_MOUNT_POINT` environment variable.

**Example**: `-host-key-mount-point custom-ssh/`
