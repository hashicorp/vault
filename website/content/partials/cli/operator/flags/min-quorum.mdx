**`-min-quorum (integer : -1)`**

The minimum number of servers that should always be present in a cluster. 
Autopilot will not prune servers below this number.

**There is no default for this value** and it should be set to the expected
number of voters in your cluster when `cleanup_dead_servers` is set as `true`.

Use the [quorum size guidance](/vault/docs/internals/integrated-storage#quorum-size-and-failure-tolerance)
to determine the proper minimum quorum size for your cluster. This value should
be at least 3.

**Example**: `-min-quorum 3`
