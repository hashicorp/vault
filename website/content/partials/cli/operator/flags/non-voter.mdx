**`-non-voter (boolean : false)`**

This flag is used to make the server not participate in the Raft quorum, and 
have it only receive the data replication stream. This can be used to add 
read scalability to a cluster in cases where a high volume of reads to servers 
are needed.

<Note title="Enterprise only">

This flag is only available in Vault Enterprise.
