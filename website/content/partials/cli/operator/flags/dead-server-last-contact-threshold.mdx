**`-dead-server-last-contact-threshold (string : "24h")`**

Limit on the amount of time a server can go without leader contact before being 
considered failed. This takes effect only when `cleanup_dead_servers` is set. 
When adding new nodes to your cluster, the `dead_server_last_contact_threshold` 
needs to be larger than the amount of time that it takes to load a Raft snapshot, 
otherwise the newly added nodes will be removed from your cluster before they have 
finished loading the snapshot and starting up. If you are using an 
[HSM](/vault/docs/enterprise/hsm), your `dead_server_last_contact_threshold`
needs to be larger than the response time of the HSM.

<Warning>

We strongly recommend keeping `dead_server_last_contact_threshold` at a high
duration, such as a day, as it being too low could result in removal of nodes
that aren't actually dead.

</Warning>

**Example**: `-dead-server-last-contact-threshold 48h`
