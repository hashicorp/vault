**`-max-parallel (integer : 10)`**

Allows the operator to specify the maximum number of lightweight threads 
(goroutines) which may be used to migrate data in parallel. This can potentially 
speed up migration on slower backends at the cost of more resources (e.g. CPU, 
memory). Permitted values range from `1` (synchronous) to the maximum value for 
an `integer`. 

<Note>

The maximum number of concurrent requests handled by a storage backend is 
ultimately governed by the storage backend configuration setting, which enforces 
a maximum number of concurrent requests (`max_parallel`).

**Example**: `-max-parallel 20`
