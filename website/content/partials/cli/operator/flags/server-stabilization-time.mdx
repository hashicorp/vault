**`-server-stabilization-time (string : "10s")`**

Minimum amount of time a server must be in a healthy state before it can become 
a voter. Until that happens, it will be visible as a peer in the cluster, but 
as a non-voter, meaning it won't contribute to quorum.

**Example**: `-server-stabilization-time 20s`
