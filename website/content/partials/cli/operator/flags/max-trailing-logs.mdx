**`-max-trailing-logs (integer : 1000)`**

Amount of entries in the Raft Log that a server can be behind before being 
considered unhealthy. If this value is too low, it can cause the cluster to 
lose quorum if a follower falls behind. This value only needs to be increased 
from the default if you have a very high write load on Vault and you see that 
it takes a long time to promote new servers to becoming voters. This is an 
unlikely scenario and most users should not modify this value.

**Example**: `-max-trailing-logs 1000`
