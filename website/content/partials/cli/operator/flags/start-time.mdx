**`-start-time (string : "")`**

Start of report period. Defaults to billing start time.

The output shows the exact time range being reported, which may not match the 
input parameters if a full month is not available, or if the available reports 
are a subset of the months requested.

**Example**: `-start-time "2020-01"`
