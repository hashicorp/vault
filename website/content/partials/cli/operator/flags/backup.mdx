**`-backup (boolean : false)`**

Store a backup of the current PGP encrypted unseal or recovery keys in Vault's 
core. The encrypted values can be recovered in the event of failure or discarded 
after success. Refer to the `-backup-delete` and `-backup-retrieve` options for 
more information. This option only applies when the existing unseal or recovery 
keys were PGP encrypted.

**Example**: `-backup`
