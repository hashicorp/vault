**`-consul-auto (boolean : false)`**

Perform automatic service discovery using Consul in HA mode. When all nodes in 
a Vault HA cluster are registered with Consul, enabling this option will
trigger automatic service discovery based on the provided `-consul-service` 
value. When Consul is Vault's HA backend, this functionality is automatically 
enabled. Ensure the proper Consul environment variables are set 
(`CONSUL_HTTP_ADDR`, etc). When only one Vault server is discovered, it will be 
initialized automatically. When more than one Vault server is discovered, they 
will each be output for selection.

**Example**: `-consul-auto`
