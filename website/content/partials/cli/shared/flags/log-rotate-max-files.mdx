**`-log-rotate-max-files (int : 0)`**

</a>

The number of log file archives to preserve over time:

- *`n`* - Preserve up to `n` archived logs.
- *`0`* - Never delete log archives.
- *`-1`* - Always delete log archives.

The archived name of rotated logs includes a timestamp indicating when the log
rotated. For example, the file `/var/log/agent.log` archives to
`/var/log/agent-{timestamp}.log` before resetting.

**Example**: `-log-rotate-max-files 5`
