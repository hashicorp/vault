**`[-disable-redirects | VAULT_DISABLE_REDIRECTS] (bool : false)`**

Disable the default CLI redirect behavior so the CLI honors the first redirect
response from the underlying API instead of following the full HTTP redirect
chain.

**Examples**:

- CLI flag: `-disable-redirects`
- Environment variable: `export VAULT_DISABLE_REDIRECTS=1`

<Warning>

  Disabling the default redirect behavior may cause commands that redirect
  requests to primary cluster notes (like `vault operator raft snapshot`) to
  misbehave.

</Warning>
