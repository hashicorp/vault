Allow communication between the CLI and Vault server before verifying the
authentication certificate presented by Vault.

**Example**: `export VAULT_SKIP_VERIFY=1`

  Do not use `VAULT_SKIP_VERIFY` in production. Skipping certificate
  verification violates the Vault security model and voids any associated 
  security guarantees.
