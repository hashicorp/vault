**`VAULT_MAX_RETRIES (integer : 2)`**

The number of times the CLI should retry a request to the Vault server when the
CLI receives one of the following recoverable error codes:

- **`412`** - "Client consistency requirement not satisfied"
- **`5xx`** - Any server error except `501`, which Vault does not use.

To disable retrying, set `VAULT_MAX_RETRIES` to `0`.

**Example**: `export VAULT_MAX_RETRIES=5`
