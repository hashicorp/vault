**`-path (string : "")`**

The path where the secrets engine will be accessible. This must be unique cross
all secrets engines. This defaults to the "type" of the secrets engine.

<Note title="Case-sensitive">

The path where you enable secrets engines is case-sensitive. For example, the KV
secrets engine enabled at `kv/` and `KV/` are treated as two distinct instances
of KV secrets engine.

</Note>

**Example**: `-path "aws"`
