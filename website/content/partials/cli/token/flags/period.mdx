**`-period (duration : "")`**

If specified, every renewal will use the given period. Periodic tokens do not 
expire as long as they are actively being renewed (unless `-explicit-max-ttl` is 
also provided). This flag requires sudo permissions. Uses 
[duration format strings](/vault/docs/concepts/duration-format).

**Example**: `-period "1h"`
