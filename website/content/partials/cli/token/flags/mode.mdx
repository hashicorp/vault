**`-mode (string : "")`**

Type of revocation to perform. If unspecified, Vault will revoke the token and 
all of the token's children. If `"orphan"`, Vault will revoke only the token, 
leaving the children as orphans. If `"path"`, Vault deletes tokens created from 
the given authentication path prefix along with their children.

**Example**: `-mode=orphan`
