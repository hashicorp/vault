- `token_bound_cidrs` `(array: [] or comma-delimited string: "")` - List of
  CIDR blocks; if set, specifies blocks of IP addresses which can authenticate
  successfully, and ties the resulting token to these blocks as well.
- `token_explicit_max_ttl` `(integer: 0 or string: "")` - If set, will encode
  an [explicit max
  TTL](/vault/docs/concepts/tokens#token-time-to-live-periodic-tokens-and-explicit-max-ttls)
  onto the token. This is a hard cap even if `token_ttl` and `token_max_ttl`
  would otherwise allow a renewal.
- `token_no_default_policy` `(bool: false)` - If set, the `default` policy will
  not be set on generated tokens; otherwise it will be added to the policies set
  in `token_policies`.
- `token_num_uses` `(integer: 0)` - The maximum number of times a generated
  token may be used (within its lifetime); 0 means unlimited.
  If you require the token to have the ability to create child tokens,
  you will need to set this value to 0.
- `token_period` `(integer: 0 or string: "")` - The maximum allowed [period](/vault/docs/concepts/tokens#token-time-to-live-periodic-tokens-and-explicit-max-ttls) value when a periodic token is requested from this role.
- `token_type` `(string: "")` - The type of token that should be generated. Can
  be `service`, `batch`, or `default` to use the mount's tuned default (which
  unless changed will be `service` tokens). For token store roles, there are two
  additional possibilities: `default-service` and `default-batch` which specify
  the type to return unless the client requests a different type at generation
  time. For machine based authentication cases, you should use `batch` 
  type tokens.
