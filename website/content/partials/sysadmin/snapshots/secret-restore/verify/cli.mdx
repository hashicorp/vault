To verify secret recovery, read the secret from the expected path. For example,
if you recovered a secret from a `kv` plugin at `telemetry-systems/api-key`:

```shell-session
$ vault kv get telemetry-systems/api-key

=== Data ===
Key    Value
---    -----
key    9C016BB3-F574-4A24-B8A7-8CE1F1CE2128
```
