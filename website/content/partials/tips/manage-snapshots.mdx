<Tip title="Backup and restore data">

All Vault editions support snapshot save and restore features for data backup and restoration. Vault Enterprise users benefit from automated snapshots to local or cloud storage, and individual secret recovery. [Manage snapshots](/vault/docs/configuration/manage-snapshots) has configuration and command examples to help you get started.
