<Tip title="Backup and restore data">

All Vault editions support snapshot save and restore features for data backup
and restoration. Vault Enterprise users benefit from automated snapshots to
local or cloud storage, and individual secret recovery.

See the [manage snapshots](/vault/docs/sysadmin/snapshots) system
administration guides for more information.
