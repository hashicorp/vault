The default billing start date used in queries and license utilization reporting will be automatically adjusted to the latest billing year. Past year billing information will still be retained.

For example, assume a customer has signed a deal for 3 years with a license start date of Dec 1, 2023. After upgrading to the version with this change, the billing start date 
auto-rolls to the most recent year.
- If the upgrade happens on Sept 1, 2024, the billing start date will continue to be Dec 1, 2023. Once we reach Dec 1, 2024, the billing start date 
will automatically roll to Dec 1, 2024. 
- If the upgrade happens on Dec 15, 2024, the billing start date should automatically roll to Dec 1, 2024 after upgrade.
