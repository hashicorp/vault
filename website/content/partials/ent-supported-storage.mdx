For enterprise customers, HashiCorp provides official support for Vault's Integrated Storage and Consul as storage backends. Vault Enterprise customers are strongly
recommended to use these supported storage backends for best outcomes. Version 1.12.0 of Vault Enterprise will not start if configured to use a storage backend
other than Integrated Storage or Consul. This was meant to protect against issues caused by using unsupported backends that do not support transactional storage.
Version 1.12.2 modified this behavior to instead log a warning when unsupported storage backends are used, while ensuring that Vault will start.
