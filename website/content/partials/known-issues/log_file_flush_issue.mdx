### Vault log file missing subsystem logs ((#log-file))

#### Fixed Versions
- 1.16.1, 1.17.14, 1.18.7, 1.19.1

#### Issue
Vault configured with log_file is not capturing all logs. Some entries, 
including plugin logs, are missing from the output file; however, 
they appear as expected in standard error and standard output.

#### Workaround
Upgrade to fixed versions.
