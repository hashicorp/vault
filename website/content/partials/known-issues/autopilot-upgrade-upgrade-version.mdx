### New nodes added by autopilot upgrades provisioned with the wrong version

#### Affected versions

- 1.15.3 - 1.15.9
- 1.16.1 - 1.16.3

#### Issue

If `autopilot_upgrade_version` is not explicitly set in the Vault configuration file in the `storage` 
section, new non-active nodes will retain their original Vault version as opposed to the new version.

#### Workaround

Set the desired version in the configuration file as `autopilot_upgrade_version=<version string>`. This will 
allow all nodes to receive the proper version to upgrade to.
