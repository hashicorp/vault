### Autopilot upgrade for Vault Enterprise fails

#### Affected versions

- 1.15.8+

#### Issue

The expected process for voter status management does not occur during the
autopilot upgrade process. The autopilot upgrade process adds new nodes (new version) as
`target_version_non_voters` then `target_version_voters` but existing nodes (old
version) fail to upgrade and maintain their current voter status.

#### Workaround

1. Disable autopilot upgrades and manually upgrade all nodes in the cluster.
1. Explicitly set the `autopilot_upgrade_version` parameter to the desired
   version in the raft `storage` stanza on your new nodes:

    ```hcl
    storage "raft" {
      autopilot_upgrade_version = "1.15.8"
    }
    ```
