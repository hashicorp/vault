### Azure Auth fails to authenticate Uniform VMSS instances ((#azure-auth-fails-uniform-vmss))

#### Affected versions

- 1.19.1+
- 1.18.7+
- 1.17.14+
- 1.16.18+

#### Issue

Azure Authentication from a uniform VMSS instance with a user assigned managed identity on the VMSS incorrectly results in an error. There was a regression introduced from adding [validations on the JWT claims](/vault/docs/auth/azure#token-validation) against the provided VM, VMSS, and resource group names without accounting for the uniform VMSS format.

#### Workaround

None at this time.
