| Bug          | 1.16.17-1.16.20, 1.17.13-1.17.16, 1.18.6-1.18.9, 1.19.0-1.19.3 | any

External Enterprise plugins can't run on a standby node when it becomes active
because standby nodes don't extract the artifact when the plugin
is registered.

#### Recommendation

As a workaround, add the plugin `.zip` artifact on every node and register the plugin on the
active node. Then, extract the contents of the zip file on the follower nodes
similar to the following folder structure for
`vault-plugin-secrets-keymgmt_0.16.0+ent_darwin_arm64.zip`.

```text
<plugin-directory>/vault-plugin-secrets-keymgmt_0.16.0+ent_darwin_arm64
├── metadata.json
├── metadata.json.sig
└── vault-plugin-secrets-keymgmt
```

Alternatively, upgrade to one of the following Vault versions: 1.16.21+, 1.17.17+,
1.18.10+, 1.19.4+. See [Register external plugins](/vault/docs/plugins/register)
for more details.
