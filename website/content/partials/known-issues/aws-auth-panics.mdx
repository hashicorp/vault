### Panic in AWS auth method during IAM-based login

#### Affected versions

- 1.15.0

#### Issue

A panic can occur in the AWS auth method during [IAM-based](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/docs/auth/aws#iam-auth-method)
login when a [client config](/vault/api-docs/auth/aws#configure-client) does not exist.

#### Workaround

The panic can be avoided by writing an empty [client config](/vault/api-docs/auth/aws#configure-client):

```shell-session
vault write -f auth/aws/config/client
```
