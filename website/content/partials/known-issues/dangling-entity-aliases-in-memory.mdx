### Deleting an entity-aliases does not remove it from the in-memory database on standby nodes

#### Affected versions

##### Vault Community Edition

- 1.16.3
- 1.17.0 - 1.17.2

##### Enterprise

- 1.16.3+ent - 1.16.6+ent
- 1.17.0+ent - 1.17.2+ent

#### Issue

Entity-aliases deleted from Vault are not removed from the in-memory database on
standby nodes within a cluster. As a result, API requests to create a new
entity-alias with the same mount accessor and name sent to a standby node will
fail.

This bug is fixed in Vault 1.16.7+ent, 1.17.3, 1.17.3+ent and later.
