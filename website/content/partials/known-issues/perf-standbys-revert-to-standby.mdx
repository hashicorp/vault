### Performance Standbys revert to Standby mode on unseal

#### Affected versions

- 1.14.12
- 1.15.8
- 1.16.2

#### Issue

Upgrading to Vault versions 1.14.12, 1.15.8, and 1.16.2 will cause Performance
Standby nodes to attempt a storage write during unseal, resulting in a read-only
storage error:

```
[ERROR] core: performance standby post-unseal setup failed: error="cannot write to readonly storage"
```

Performance Standby nodes will revert to Standby after upgrading. You can verify
the status of your cluster nodes by checking the
[/sys/health](/vault/api-docs/health.mdx) endpoint.

Deployments that rely on scaling across Performance Standbys will now forward
all requests to the active node, increasing the utilization of the active node.

A fix for the read-only storage error has been prioritized and escalated. The
fix will be in releases 1.14.13, 1.15.9 and 1.16.3.

<Warning title="Important">
If you have already upgraded to versions 1.14.12, 1.15.8, or 1.16.2, please
refer to the workaround section for options.
</Warning>

#### Workaround

There is currently no known workaround for this issue.

If you have already upgraded to the affected versions, you have two options:

1. Carefully monitor the active nodes of your upgraded clusters to ensure that
system resources are not oversaturated and request latencies are not untenably
high.

2. Consider downgrading to an earlier version of Vault and restoring from backup.

<Note title="Important">
Always back up your data before upgrading! Vault does not make
backward-compatibility guarantees for its data store. Simply replacing the
newly-installed Vault binary with the previous version will not cleanly
downgrade Vault, as upgrades may perform changes to the underlying data
structure that make the data incompatible with a downgrade. If you need to roll
back to a previous version of Vault, you should roll back your data store as
well by restoring from backup.
