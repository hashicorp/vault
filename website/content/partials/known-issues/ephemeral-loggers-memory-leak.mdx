### Vault is storing references to ephemeral sub-loggers leading to a memory leak

Vault is unexpectedly storing references to ephemeral sub-loggers which prevents them from being cleaned up, leading to
a memory leak. This impacts many areas of Vault, but primarily logins in Enterprise.
There is no workaround.

#### Affected versions

This issue affects Vault CE and Vault Enterprise versions:
- 1.13.7+
- 1.14.3+
- 1.15.0+

A fix will be issued in the next release
