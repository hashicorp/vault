### Error configuring the JWT auth method

#### Affected versions

- 1.16.1

#### Issue
An error will occur when configuring the built-in jwt auth method. This will
affect new mounts and updates to existing mounts. Existing mounts should not
encounter an error if no modifcations are made.

See this [issue](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault-plugin-auth-jwt/pull/290) for more details.

#### Workaround

Do not attempt to update an existing mount's config. New mounts can run the plugin as an external plugin to avoid the error.
