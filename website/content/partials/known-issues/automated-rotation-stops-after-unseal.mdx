### Automated Rotation Stops After Unseal

#### Affected Versions

- 1.19.0, 1.19.1, 1.19.2

#### Issue

After unsealing Vault, the rotation manager does not correctly reinstate the rotation queue. This causes configured
automated root credential rotations to stop.

#### Workaround

Update the root configuration on an affected backend to cause Vault to recreate the rotation schedule.
