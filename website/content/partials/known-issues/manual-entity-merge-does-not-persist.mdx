### Manual entity merges sent to a PR secondary cluster are not persisted to storage

#### Affected versions

- Vault Enterprise v0.7.0+

#### Issue
If you send a manual entity merge to a PR secondary cluster, the change is
temporarily reflected on the active node of the PR secondary cluster, but Vault
does not save the change to persistent storage. 

#### Workaround

Always send manual entity merge requests to the primary cluster.
