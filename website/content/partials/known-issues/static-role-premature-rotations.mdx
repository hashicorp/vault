### Static role rotations on upgrade ((#static-role-rotations))

#### Affected Versions
- 1.19.0, 1.18.5, 1.17.12, 1.16.16

#### Issue
Vault automatically rotates existing static roles tied to database and LDAP
credentials once when upgrading to an affected version. After the one-time
rotation, the static roles behave as expected.

#### Workaround
If you rely on LDAP or static database roles, avoid upgrading to the affected
versions until we fix the issue.
