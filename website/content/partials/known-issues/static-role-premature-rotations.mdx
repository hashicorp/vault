### LDAP static role rotations on upgrade ((#static-role-rotations))

#### Affected Versions
- 1.19.0, 1.19.1
- 1.18.5, 1.18.6, 1.18.7
- 1.17.12, 1.17.13, 1.17.14
- 1.16.16, 1.16.17, 1.16.18

#### Fixed Versions
- 1.19.2
- 1.18.8
- 1.17.15
- 1.16.19

#### Issue
Vault automatically rotates existing static roles tied to LDAP
credentials once when upgrading to an affected version. After the one-time
rotation, the static roles behave as expected.

#### Workaround
If you rely on LDAP static roles, avoid upgrading to the affected
versions.
