### Static role rotations on upgrade ((#static-role-rotations))

#### Affected Versions
- 1.19.0, 1.18.5, 1.17.12, 1.16.16

#### Issue
LDAP or Database static-role credentials created before the upgrade are rotated once automatically during the upgrade. 
After this one-time rotation, the static roles behave as expected.

#### Workaround
Avoid upgrading to the affected versions if you rely on LDAP or Database static roles. A fix is currently 
in progress and will be included in an upcoming release.
