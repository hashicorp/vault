### Duplicate identity groups created when concurrent requests sent to the primary and PR secondary cluster

#### Affected versions
- All Enterprise versions from 0.7.0 up

#### Issue
Duplicate identity groups are groups that have the same name, and should not be possible in vault. However, there is a race condition
in which duplicate groups are possible. If more than 1 create group request is sent at the same time to a Primary Cluster and 
the PR secondary cluster, it can result in group duplicates.

#### Workaround
All create group requests should be sent to the primary cluster.
