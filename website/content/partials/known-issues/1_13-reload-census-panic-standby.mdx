### Sending SIGHUP to vault standby node causes panic

#### Affected versions

- 1.13.4+
- 1.14.0+
- 1.15.0+
- 1.16.0+

#### Issue

Sending a SIGHUP to a vault standby node running an enterprise build can cause a panic
if there is a change to the license, or reporting configuration.
Active and performance standby nodes will perform fine. It is recommended that operators
stop and restart vault nodes individually if configuration changes are required.


#### Workaround

Instead of issuing a SIGHUP, users should stop individual vault nodes, update the configuration 
or license and then restart the node.
