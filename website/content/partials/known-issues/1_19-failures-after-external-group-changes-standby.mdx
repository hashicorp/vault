### Login/token renewal failures after group changes ((#group-writes))

#### Affected Versions
- 1.19.0

#### Issue
Performance standby nodes return a 500 error during login or token renewal if an
entity's external group association has changed. This occurs because standbys are
unable to persist the updated group membership to storage.

#### Workaround
Direct all logins and token renewals to the active node.
