### Login/token renewal failures after group changes ((#group-writes))

#### Affected Versions
- 1.19.0

#### Issue
Performance standby nodes return a 500 error during login or token renewal if an
entity's external group association has changed. This occurs because standbys are
unable to persist the updated group membership to storage. 

The login will return a read-only error:
```
* failed to persist packed storage entry: cannot write to readonly storage
```

A related debug message may also appear in Vault server logs:
```
[DEBUG] identity: adding member entity ID to external group: member_entity_id=
```

#### Workaround
Direct all logins and token renewals to the active node.
