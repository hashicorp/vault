### Login/token renewal failures after group changes ((#group-writes))

#### Affected Versions
- 1.19.0

#### Fixed Versions:
- 1.19.2*

* While the original fix was included in 1.19.1, a regression in that release impacted its effectiveness. 
We recommend upgrading to 1.19.2, which includes both the fix and the regression correction.

#### Issue
Performance standby nodes return a 500 error during login or token renewal if an
entity's external group association has changed. This occurs because standbys are
unable to persist the updated group membership to storage. The login will return a read-only error:

```
* failed to persist packed storage entry: cannot write to readonly storage
```

A related debug message may also appear in Vault server logs:
```
[DEBUG] identity: adding member entity ID to external group: member_entity_id=
```

#### Workaround
Direct all logins and token renewals to the active node.
