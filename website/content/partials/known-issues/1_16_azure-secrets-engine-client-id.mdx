### Azure secrets engine role creation failing 

#### Affected versions

- 1.16.0, 1.16.1, 1.16.2

#### Issue

Creating Azure Secrets engine roles by specifying the Azure App Registration 
Object ID as the application_object_id causes Vault to error out stating error 
loading Application: no application found. This was introduced by 
`vault-plugin-secrets-azure` v0.17.0, which incorrectly queries for an application
by client_id and not application_object_id. 

#### Workaround
Users can pass a client_id instead of an application_object_id into the 
application_object_id parameter. However, after upgrading to a version with a fix 
(1.16.3+), the user will need to remember to switch back to the application_object_id.
