### Vault Enterprise Performance Standby nodes audit all request headers

#### Affected versions

- 1.15.0 - 1.15.7

#### Issue

Due to a bug in the Enterprise unsealing process, when using the new event framework Performance
Standby nodes in a Vault Enterprise cluster do not correctly receive configuration
providing them with the settings for which request headers should be written to the audit log.

Rather than no headers appearing in the audit logs, Vault Enterprise logs **all**
headers on Performance Standby nodes.

The header issue was resolved in `1.15.8`.

#### Workaround

Set the `VAULT_AUDIT_DISABLE_EVENTLOGGER` environment variable to `true` to
disable the new underlying event framework and restart Vault:

```shell-session
$ export VAULT_AUDIT_DISABLE_EVENTLOGGER=true
```

On startup, Vault reverts to the audit behavior used in `1.14.x`.
