### Duplicate HSM Keys and KV Read Failures

#### Affected Versions
- All versions that support HSM seal integration with HA configurations.

#### Issue
Clusters using HSM for sealing in HA configurations may experience unexpected behavior under certain conditions:
- Duplicate HSM keys: These may be created, resulting in intermittent KV read failures with errors such as CKR_SIGNATURE_INVALID and CKR_KEY_HANDLE_INVALID.
- Unseal failures: Nodes may fail to unseal after a restart, with errors such as CKR_DATA_INVALID.
- Node risk: While remaining nodes may stay operational, restarting them could lead to similar unseal failures.
These issues can occur even after a seal migration to HSM that initially appeared successful. The root cause is under investigation, with potential links to key handling during HA configuration or migration processes.

#### Workaround
To minimize the risk of encountering this issue, avoid running Vault with generate_key = true after the initial initialization of the cluster. This setting should only be used during the initial setup to prevent unintended key generation or duplication.
