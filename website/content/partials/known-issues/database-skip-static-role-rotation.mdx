### Database and LDAP Secrets Engine - Unwanted secret rotation on backend restart

#### Affected Versions
- All versions that support skipping automatic import rotation of static roles.

#### Issue
The Database secrets engine and the LDAP secrets engine both support skipping
automatic import rotation of static roles with the config-level field
`skip_static_role_import_rotation` and the static role-level field
`skip_import_rotation`.

Any static roles configured with either of these fields set to true will have
their passwords rotated when Vault is restarted. The password rotation will not
occur on restart if the static role has already had its password rotated.

#### Workaround
Upgrade to Vault version 1.18.6+ and 1.19.1+. For earlier versions of Vault, the only
workaround avoiding restarts of the backend.
