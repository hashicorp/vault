### Audit fails to recover from panics when formatting audit entries

#### Affected versions

- 1.15.0 - 1.15.5

#### Issue

Due to an issue in the new event framework, Vault tries to resolve panics that
occur when formatting audit entries. Vault cannot resolve the panic correctly,
which results in the server terminating unexpectedly.

The panic issue was resolved in `1.15.6`.

#### Workaround

Set the `VAULT_AUDIT_DISABLE_EVENTLOGGER` environment variable to `true` to
disable the new underlying event framework and restart Vault:

```shell-session
$ export VAULT_AUDIT_DISABLE_EVENTLOGGER=true
```

On startup, Vault reverts to the audit behavior used in `1.14.x`.
