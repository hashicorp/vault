### Existing clusters do not show the current Vault version in UI by default

#### Affected versions

- 1.16.0

#### Issue

Previous versions of the Vault UI fetched version information from
un-authenticated endpoints like `sys/health` and `sys/seal-status`. Since
introducing the `redact_version` TCP listener parameter, version information may
no longer be available under some configurations. As a result, the Vault UI now
uses a new, **authenticated** endpoint (`sys/internal/ui/version`) to fetch
version information.

The following rule has been added to the **default** policy that is automatically generated on
new Vault server.

```
# Allow a token to look up the Vault version. This path is not subject to
# redaction like the unauthenticated endpoints that provide the Vault version.
path "sys/internal/ui/version" {
    capabilities = ["read"]
}
```

However, the default policy for **existing** Vault servers does not update
automatically during the upgrade. You must updated the policy manually in order
for the Vault version to be displayed in the Vault UI.

No other functionality in the Vault UI is affected be this issue.

To update the **default** policy, use the following commands:
```shell-session
$ vault policy read default | cat - <<< '
# Allow a token to look up the Vault version. This path is not subject to
# redaction like the unauthenticated endpoints that provide the Vault version.
path "sys/internal/ui/version" {
    capabilities = ["read"]
}
' > default-policy.hcl
$ vault policy write default ./default-policy.hcl
```

This change to the default policy will allow the Vault UI to successfully query
the Vault server version and display it to the users.
