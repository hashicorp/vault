### Authorization failures using Azure federated identity credentials

A regression was introduced when attempting to fix automated unsealing
using managed identity based credentials. The regression occurs when
using Azure federated identity credentials supplying the client ID
via an environment variable or through configuration while not
supplying the tenant id and client secret.

The regression causes authorization failures within auto-unseal,
managed keys and seal wrapping.
