### Database static role rotations on upgrade ((#db-static-role-rotations))

#### Affected Upgrade Path
* This issue only occurs when upgrading from the following initial versions to the following target versions:

Initial Versions (any version prior to 1.15.0):
- 1.14.x
- 1.13.x
- and earlier

Target Versions:
- 1.19.0, 1.19.1, 1.19.2
- 1.18.5, 1.18.6, 1.18.7, 1.18.8
- 1.17.12, 1.17.13, 1.17.14, 1.17.15
- 1.16.16, 1.16.17, 1.16.18, 1.16.19

#### Issue
Vault automatically rotates existing static roles tied to Database
credentials once when upgrading to an affected target version from an 
affected initial version. After the one-time rotation, the static roles behave as expected.

#### Workaround
If you rely on Database static roles and are currently on a version prior to 1.15.0, 
avoid upgrading directly to the target versions listed above.
