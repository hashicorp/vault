### Database static role rotations on upgrade ((#db-static-role-rotations))

#### Affected Versions
- Target Versions: 
    - 1.19.0, 1.19.1
    - 1.18.5, 1.18.6, 1.18.7
    - 1.17.12, 1.17.13, 1.17.14
    - 1.16.16, 1.16.17, 1.16.18
- Initial Versions:
    - including and prior to: 1.15.0, 1.14.4, 1.13.8

#### Issue
Vault automatically rotates existing static roles tied to Database
credentials once when upgrading to an affected target version from an 
affected initial version. After the one-time rotation, the static roles behave as expected.

#### Workaround
If you rely on Database static roles and are on a version prior to 1.15.0, 1.14.4, 1.13.8, 
avoid upgrading to the affected versions.
