### Internal error when vault policy in namespace does not exist
If a user is a member of a group that gets a policy from a 
namespace other than the one they’re trying to log into, 
and that policy doesn’t exist, Vault returns an internal error. 
This impacts all auth methods.

#### Affected versions
- 1.13.8 and 1.13.9
- 1.14.4 and 1.14.5
- 1.15.0 and 1.15.1

A fix will be released in Vault 1.15.2, 1.14.6, and 1.13.10.

### Workaround

During authentication, Vault derives inherited policies based on the groups an
entity belongs to. Vault returns an internal error when attaching the derived
policy to a token when:

1. the token belongs to a different namespace than the one handling
   authentication, and
2. the derived policy does not exist under the namespace.


You can resolve the error by adding the policy to the relevant namespace or
deleting the group policy mapping that uses the derived policy.

As an example, consider the following userpass auth method failure. The error is
due to the fact that Vault expects a group policy under the namespace that does 
not exist.

<CodeBlockConfig hideClipboard>

```shell-session
# Failed login
$ vault login -method=userpass username=user1 password=123
Error authenticating: Error making API request.

URL: PUT http://127.0.0.1:8200/v1/auth/userpass/login/user1
Code: 500. Errors:

* internal error
```

</CodeBlockConfig>

To confirm the problem is a missing policy, start by identifying the relevant
entity and group IDs:

<CodeBlockConfig hideClipboard>

```shell-session
$ vault read -format=json identity/entity/name/user1 | \
  jq '{"entity_id": .data.id, "group_ids": .data.group_ids} '
{
  "entity_id": "420c82de-57c3-df2e-2ef6-0690073b1636",
  "group_ids": [
    "6cb152b7-955d-272b-4dcf-a2ed668ca1ea"
  ]
}
```

</CodeBlockConfig>

Use the group ID to fetch the relevant policies for the group under the `ns1`
namespace:

<CodeBlockConfig hideClipboard>

```shell-session
$ vault read -format=json -namespace=ns1 \
  identity/group/id/6cb152b7-955d-272b-4dcf-a2ed668ca1ea | \
  jq '.data.policies'
[
  "group_policy"
]
```

</CodeBlockConfig>
Now that we know Vault is looking for a policy called `group_policy`, we can
check whether that policy exists under the `ns1` namespace:

<CodeBlockConfig hideClipboard>

```shell-session
$ vault policy list -namespace=ns1
default
```

</CodeBlockConfig>

The only policy in the `ns1` namespace is `default`, which confirms that the
missing policy (`group_policy`) is causing the error.


To fix the problem, we can either remove the missing policy from the
`6cb152b7-955d-272b-4dcf-a2ed668ca1ea` group or create the missing policy under
the `ns1` namespace.

To remove `group_policy` from group ID `6cb152b7-955d-272b-4dcf-a2ed668ca1ea`,
use the `vault write` command to set the applicable policies to just include
`default`:

```shell-session
$ vault write                                             \
  -namespace=ns1                                          \
  identity/group/id/6cb152b7-955d-272b-4dcf-a2ed668ca1ea  \
  name="test"                                             \
  policies="default"
```

</Tab>

<Tab heading="Add the policy to ns1">

To create the missing policy, use `vault policy write` and define the
appropriate capabilities:

```shell-session
$ vault policy write -namespace=ns1 group_policy - << EOF
    path "secret/data/*" {
	    capabilities = ["create", "update"]
    }
EOF
```

</Tab>

Verify the fix by re-running the login command:

<CodeBlockConfig hideClipboard>

```shell-session
$ vault login -method=userpass username=user1 password=123`
```
