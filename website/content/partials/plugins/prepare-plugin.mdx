You must have the plugin set up properly in your configured plugin director.
Vault expects specific path structures based on the integration, license, and
file format.

If you plan to register a `.zip` file, the extracted folder name must match the
official file name. For example,
`vault-plugin-database-oracle_0.11.0+ent_linux_amd64.zip` must exist in the
plugin directory under `vault-plugin-database-oracle_0.11.0+ent_linux_amd64/`.

Integration | License    | File   | Path structure
----------- | ---------- | ------ | --------------
Official    | Enterprise | `.zip` | `<plugin_directory>/<extracted-folder-name>/`
Official    | Community  | `.zip` | Not supported
Community   | N/A        | `.zip` | Not supported
Official    | Enterprise | binary | Not supported
Offical     | Community  | binary | `<plugin_directory>/<binary-name>`
Community   | N/A        | binary | `<plugin_directory>/<binary-name>`

<Note title="Deprecated .zip file support">

Vault v1.20.x removed `.zip` file support for official community plugins.
Earlier versions of Vault (v1.16.21+, 1.17.17+, 1.18.10+, or 1.19.5+) support
`.zip` files extracted to `<plugin_directory>/<extracted-folder-name>/` if the
extracted files include  `metadata.json` and `metadata.json.sig` files that
authenticate the plugin.
