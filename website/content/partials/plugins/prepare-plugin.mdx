You must have the plugin set up properly in your configured plugin directory.
Vault expects specific path structures based on the integration, license, and
file format.

If you plan to register an extracted `.zip` file, the extracted artifact
directory name must match the official file name. For example, to register
`vault-plugin-database-oracle_0.11.0+ent_linux_amd64.zip`, you must extract it
to the plugin directory as `vault-plugin-database-oracle_0.11.0+ent_linux_amd64/`.

Integration | License    | Source | Path structure

Official    | Enterprise | binary | Not supported
Offical     | Community  | binary | `<plugin_directory>/<binary-name>`
