If a user provides bad credentials several times in quick succession,
Vault will stop trying to validate their credentials for a while, instead returning immediately
with a permission denied error. We call this behavior "user lockout". The time for which
a user will be locked out is called “lockout duration”. The user will be able to login after the lockout
duration has passed. The number of failed login attempts after which the user is locked out is called
“lockout threshold”. The lockout threshold counter is reset to zero after a few minutes without login attempts,
or upon a successful login attempt. The duration after which the counter will be reset to zero
after no login attempts is called "lockout counter reset". This can defeat both automated and targeted requests
i.e, user-based password guessing attacks as well as automated attacks.

The user lockout feature is enabled by default. The default values for "lockout threshold" is 5 attempts,
"lockout duration" is 15 minutes, "lockout counter reset" is 15 minutes.

The user lockout feature can be disabled as follows:
- It can be disabled globally using environment variable `VAULT_DISABLE_USER_LOCKOUT`.
- It can be disabled for all supported auth methods (ldap, userpass and approle) or a specific supported auth method using the `disable_lockout`
  parameter within `user_lockout` stanza in configuration file.
  Please see [user lockout configuration](/vault/docs/configuration/user-lockout#user_lockout-stanza) for more details.
- It can be disabled for a specific auth mount using "auth tune". Please see [auth tune command](/vault/docs/commands/auth/tune)
  or [auth tune api](/vault/api-docs/system/auth#tune-auth-method) for more details.

~> **NOTE**: This feature is available from Vault version 1.13 and is only supported by the userpass, ldap, and approle auth methods.
