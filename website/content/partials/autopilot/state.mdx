When verifying the health of your cluster, check the following fields of each server:
- `healthy`: whether Autopilot considers this node healthy or not
- `status`: the voting status of the node. If the
- `last_index`: the index of the last applied Raft log. This should be close to the `last_index` value of the leader.
- `version`: the version of Vault running on the server
- `node_type`: the type of node. On CE, this will always be `voter`. See below for an explanation of Enterprise node types.

### Enterprise only
Vault Enterprise will include additional output in its API response to indicate the current state of redundancy zones,
automated upgrade progress (if any), and optimistic failure tolerance.

`optimistic_failure_tolerance` describes the number of healthy active and
back-up voting servers that can fail gradually without causing an outage.

#### Node Types
- `voter`: The server is a Raft voter and contributing to quorum.
- `read-replica`: The server is not a Raft voter, but receives a replica of all data.
- `zone-voter`: The main Raft voter in a redundancy zone.
- `zone-extra-voter`: An additional Raft voter in a redundancy zone.
- `zone-standby`: A non-voter in a redundancy zone that can be promoted to a voter, if needed.
