### PKI OCSP GET requests can return HTTP redirect responses

If a base64 encoded OCSP request contains consecutive '/' characters, the GET request
will return a 301 permanent redirect response. If the redirection is followed, the
request will not decode as it will not be a properly base64 encoded request.

As a workaround, OCSP POST requests can be used which are unaffected.
