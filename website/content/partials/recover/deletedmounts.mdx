<Note>

  A path cannot be read, listed, or recovered from a snapshot if the path's
  mount has been disabled! Even if you later re-enable the same plugin at the
  same path, the underlying identifiers for the plugin will be different and
  Vault will not be able to find the underlying storage entries for the mount
  within the snapshot.
