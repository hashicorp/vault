### Can I compute KMIP clients for Vault? ((#kmip))

**No**.

Currently, KMIP clients are not available via the usage metrics UI or client
count API.

### Can I get monthly changes for Vault versions older than v1.10? ((#month-to-month))

**Yes, for Vault v1.8 &ndash; v1.10.**

To calculate client counts for a given month, you must perform a series of
billing period updates in the UI and manual calculations:

Month     | Billing period in UI     | Result       | Computation
--------- | ------------------------ | ------------ | -----------
January   | January                  | `JAN`        | None
February  | January &nbsp; February  | `JAN_FEB`    | `FEB = JAN_FEB - JAN` 
March     | January &nbsp; February  | `JAN_MAR`    | `MAR = JAN_MAR - JAN_FEB` 
April     | January &nbsp; February  | `JAN_APR`    | `APR = JAN_APR - JAN_MAR` 
May       | January &nbsp; February  | `JAN_MAY`    | `MAY = JAN_MAY - JAN_APR` 
June      | January &nbsp; February  | `JAN_JUN`    | `JUN = JAN_JUN - JAN_MAY` 
July      | January &nbsp; February  | `JAN_JUL`    | `JUL = JAN_JUL - JAN_JUN` 
August    | January &nbsp; February  | `JAN_AUG`    | `AUG = JAN_AUG - JAN_JUL` 
September | January &nbsp; September | `JAN_SEP`    | `SEP = JAN_SEP - JAN_AUG` 
October   | January &nbsp; February  | `JAN_OCT`    | `OCT = JAN_OCT - JAN_SEP` 
November  | January &nbsp; February  | `JAN_NOV`    | `NOV = JAN_NOV - JAN_OCT` 
December  | January &nbsp; February  | `JAN_DEV`    | `DEC = JAN_DEC - JAN_NOV` 

### Do child namespaces create duplication in the client count? ((#namespace-dupes))

**Maybe**.

Tokens created in a parent namespace are recognized as the same client when used
in a child namespace. But, tokens created **across** a parent/child namespace
boundary may be counted as multiple clients. See the
[clients and entities](/vault/docs/concepts/client-count) overview for more
details.

### Does the Nomad-Vault integration affect client counts? ((#nomad))

**Yes**.

The [Nomad Vault integration](/nomad/docs/integrations/vault-integration)
uses either Workload Identity (JWT) or token roles for client count:

    - Vault bases Workload Identity client counts on the
      [`user_claim`](/vault/api-docs/auth/jwt#user_claim) field. The
      recommended default is `nomad_job`, which results in 1 client per
      Nomad job.
    - Nomad deprecated token roles and will remove the feature in v1.10. Client
      counts for legacy token roles treat each unique policy combination as 1
    	non-entity client.

### Are batch tokens counted differently than service tokens? ((#batch-tokens))

**No**.

Batch token clients are counted like service token clients. The batch token is
mapped to either to the associated active entity or an artificial entity that
Vault creates by combining the assigned namespace and policy. See the
[clients and entities](/vault/docs/concepts/client-count) overview for more
details.

### Do custom user filters affect client counts? ((#custom-filters))

**Yes**.

Custom [user filters](/vault/api-docs/auth/ldap#userfilter) can change the way
that entity aliases are mapped, which can affect the client count computation.

Consult the [clients and entities](/vault/docs/concepts/client-count) overview
for more information about how Vault determines entity assignments.

### Does mount migration affect client counts? ((#mount-migration))

**Maybe**.

If you are using Vault 1.10+:

- Migrating mounts **across** namespace will create duplication in the client count.
- Migrating mounts **within** a namespace will not affect client count.

If you are using an older version of Vault, migrating mounts will always create
duplication in the client count.
