### Can I view the list of unique client IDs that contributed to my client count aggregate? ((#view-data))

**Yes, if you are using Vault 1.11 or later**.

As of Vault 1.11, you can export the list of unique
clients that contributed to your client count for a given billing period with
the
[activity export API endpoint](/vault/api-docs/system/internal-counters#activity-export).

### Is clientID viewable in the audit logs for non-entity tokens? ((#clientid-in-logs))

**Yes, for Vault v1.9+**.

As of Vault v1.9, audit logs include a field called `clientID` that records the
active or computed entity ID of the associated token.

### Can I skip client computation for a period of time during the billing period? ((#skip-computation))

**Yes, but the data may be inaccurate**.

Breaking up the data will likely result in client duplication. For example,
assume your billing period runs from January 1st to December 31st, and you break
the computation into two periods to exclude the month of April:

- Period<sub>1</sub> runs from January 1st to March 31st
- Period<sub>2</sub> runs from June 1st to December 31st

Vault treats the two requests independently so January 1st and June 1st are both
used as a fresh start to re-count unique clients. Any client that was active
during both periods will appear in both result sets, even though Vault will only
counted that client **once** for the actual billing period.

### Are there conditions that will cause me to lose client data? ((#lost-data))

**Yes**.

The Vault activity log handles client computation. The standby nodes track and
accumulate activity log data then transmit updates to the active node over gRPC
whenever the log grows by 8KB or 10 minutes has elapsed, whichever happens
first.

If a node goes down during the accumulation phase you will lose the
untransmitted data in addition to any client count data that would have been
collected during the outage.

### What happens if a portion of the data is missing for my billing period? ((#missing-data))

**Vault only returns the most recent contiguous set of data**.

For example, assume your billing period runs from January 1st to December 31st
but you disabled tracking for the month of April. Vault will look for the
largest, contiguous window of time where data is available, May through December,
and compute results for that period of time. May 2021 through December 2021.

### Can I disable client counting? ((#disable-client-count))

**Yes**.

You can use the Vault API to
[update the client count configuration](/vault/api-docs/system/internal-counters#update-the-client-count-configuration)
and disable the tracking parameter. If you disable client counting in the middle
of a month, Vault will discard any data currently recorded for the month. Data
for previous months is preserved.

<Note>

  <EnterpriseAlert product="vault" inline /> 

  License utilization cannot be reported if client counting is disabled. 
  
  As of 1.16.0, 1.15.6 and 1.14.10, client counting cannot be disabled as manual license utilization reporting is always enabled.

  As of 1.14.0, 1.13.4, 1.12.8 and 1.11.12, client counting cannot be disabled when automated license utilization reporting is enabled. 

</Note>


### Can I configure Vault to log the client count data? ((#log-client-count))

**Yes**.

You can use the Vault API to
[update the client count configuration](/vault/api-docs/system/internal-counters#update-the-client-count-configuration)
and specify your preferred retention period.
