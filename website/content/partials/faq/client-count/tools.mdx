### What is the Vault auditor? ((##vault-auditor))

@include 'alerts/auditor-deprecated.mdx'

The Vault auditor tool
lets customers running Vault v1.3 &ndash; v1.5 compute and display client
count data using the client compute logic available in Vault 1.7. Auditor use
with Vault versions older than 1.3 is untested.

The auditor may report that your audit logs are unreadable of the logs are too
large or you are running an older version than Vault 1.6.


### Are there any known client count issues in the auditor tool? ((#auditor-ki))

**Yes**.

The Vault auditor only includes the computation logic improvements from Vault
v1.6 &ndash; v1.7. Running the auditor on Vault v1.8+ will result in
discrepancies when comparing the result to data available through the 
Vault UI or API.
