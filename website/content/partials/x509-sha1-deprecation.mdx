~> **Note**: This engine can use external X.509 certificates as part of TLS or signature validation.
   Verifying signatures against X.509 certificates that use SHA-1 is deprecated and will no longer be
   usable without a workaround starting in Vault 1.12. See the
   [deprecation FAQ](/docs/deprecation/faq#q-what-is-the-impact-of-removing-support-for-x-509-certificates-with-signatures-that-use-sha-1)
   for more information.
