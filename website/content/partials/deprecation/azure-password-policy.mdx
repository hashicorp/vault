The `password_policy` field for the Azure secrets plugin is deprecated. The
MS Graph API now returns passwords to the client rather than accepting
passwords as part of the request. As a result, the `password_policy` field is
unusable.

For more information, consult the Microsoft documentation for
[MS GRAPH APP API](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/application-addpassword?view=graph-rest-1.0&tabs=http)
and
[MS GRAPH SP API](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/serviceprincipal-addpassword?view=graph-rest-1.0&tabs=http).
