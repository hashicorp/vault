The ability to duplicate attributes in HCL configuration files and policy definitions is deprecated.

To find affected policies, look for "policy contains duplicate attributes"
warnings in the server logs. Once we remove support for duplicate attributes,
you cannot interact with affected policies. For example, Vault will return an
error if you try to create a token referencing an affected policy or use an
existing token that references the policy.

The Vault CLI now checks provided configuration files to determine if the file
is subject to the duplicate parameter deprecation and returns a warning about
the issue.
