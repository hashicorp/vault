The usage of duplicate attributes in HCL configuration files and policy definitions is deprecated.

Look for "policy contains duplicate attributes" warnings in the server logs to identify if you are affected, once
support for duplicate attributes ends any attempts to interact with such policies will result fail, like creating a
token referencing it or even using a token that references it.

Configuration files provided to any Vault CLI commands are also subject to this deprecation and will warn about the
usage of duplicate attributes.
