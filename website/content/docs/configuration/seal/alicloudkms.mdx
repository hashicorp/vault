# `alicloudkms` seal

<Note title="Seal wrapping requires Vault Enterprise">

  All Vault versions support **auto-unseal** for AliCloud, but **seal wrapping**
  requires Vault Enterprise.
  
  Vault Enterprise enables seal wrapping by default, which means the KMS service
  must be available at runtime and not just during the unseal process. Refer to
  the [Seal wrap](/vault/docs/enterprise/sealwrap) overview for more
  information.

</Note>


The AliCloud KMS seal configures Vault to use AliCloud KMS as the seal wrapping mechanism.
The AliCloud KMS seal is activated by one of the following:

- The presence of a `seal "alicloudkms"` block in Vault's configuration file.
- The presence of the environment variable `VAULT_SEAL_TYPE` set to `alicloudkms`. If
  enabling via environment variable, all other required values specific to AliCloud
  KMS (i.e. `VAULT_ALICLOUDKMS_SEAL_KEY_ID`) must be also supplied, as well as all
  other AliCloud-related environment variables that lends to successful
  authentication.

## `alicloudkms` example

This example shows configuring AliCloud KMS seal through the Vault configuration file
by providing all the required values:

```hcl
seal "alicloudkms" {
  region     = "us-east-1"
  access_key = "0wNEpMMlzy7szvai"
  secret_key = "PupkTg8jdmau1cXxYacgE736PJj4cA"
  kms_key_id = "08c33a6f-4e0a-4a1b-a3fa-7ddfa1d4fb73"
}
```

## `alicloudkms` parameters

These parameters apply to the `seal` stanza in the Vault configuration file:

- `region` `(string: <required> "us-east-1")`: The AliCloud region where the encryption key
  lives. May also be specified by the `ALICLOUD_REGION`
  environment variable.

- `domain` `(string: "kms.us-east-1.aliyuncs.com")`: If set, overrides the endpoint
  AliCloud would normally use for KMS for a particular region. May also be specified
  by the `ALICLOUD_DOMAIN` environment variable.

- `access_key` `(string: <required>)`: The AliCloud access key ID to use. May also be
  specified by the `ALICLOUD_ACCESS_KEY` environment variable or as part of the
  AliCloud profile from the AliCloud CLI or instance profile.

- `secret_key` `(string: <required>)`: The AliCloud secret access key to use. May
  also be specified by the `ALICLOUD_SECRET_KEY` environment variable or as
  part of the AliCloud profile from the AliCloud CLI or instance profile.

- `kms_key_id` `(string: <required>)`: The AliCloud KMS key ID to use for encryption
  and decryption. May also be specified by the `VAULT_ALICLOUDKMS_SEAL_KEY_ID`
  environment variable.

- `disabled` `(string: "")`: Set this to `true` if Vault is migrating from an auto seal configuration. Otherwise, set to `false`.

Refer to the [Seal Migration](/vault/docs/concepts/seal#seal-migration) documentation for more information about the seal migration process.

## Authentication

Authentication-related values must be provided, either as environment
variables or as configuration parameters.

~> **Note:** Although the configuration file allows you to pass in
`ALICLOUD_ACCESS_KEY` and `ALICLOUD_SECRET_KEY` as part of the seal's parameters, it
is _strongly_ recommended to set these values via environment variables.

```text
AliCloud authentication values:

* `ALICLOUD_REGION`
* `ALICLOUD_ACCESS_KEY`
* `ALICLOUD_SECRET_KEY`
```

Note: The client uses the official AliCloud SDK and will use environment credentials,
the specified credentials, or RAM role credentials in that order.

## `alicloudkms` environment variables

Alternatively, the AliCloud KMS seal can be activated by providing the following
environment variables:

```text
Vault Seal specific values:

* `VAULT_SEAL_TYPE`
* `VAULT_ALICLOUDKMS_SEAL_KEY_ID`
```
