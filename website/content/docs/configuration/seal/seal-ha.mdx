# Seal High Availability (Beta)

<Note title="Seal HA functionality requires Vault Enterprise">

  Seal High Availability requires Vault Enterprise.

</Note>

-> **Warning:** This feature is available as a Beta for evaluation and should not 
be used in production deployments of Vault.

[Seal High Availability](/vault/docs/content/concepts/seal#Seal-High-Availability) 
is the ability to configure more than one seal in order to have resilience against
outage of a seal service or mechanism.   

Using Seal HA involves configuring extra seals in Vault's server configuration file
and restarting Vault, after having enabled the Seal HA beta feature by setting
the environment variable:

`VAULT_ENABLE_SEAL_HA_BETA=true`

Before using Seal HA, one must have upgraded to Vault 1.15 or higher, and started
Vault without the feature.  Afterward, the feature may be enabled by adding
a seal

## Adding and Removing Seals

Seal HA adds two new fields to the seal configuration stanza, `name`, and
`priority`:

```hcl
seal [TYPE] {
  name = "seal-name"
  priority = "1"
  # ...
}
```

Name is optional, and if not specified is set to the type of the seal.  Names
must be unique.  If using two seals of the same type name must be specified.
Internally, name is used to disambiguate seal wrapped values in some cases,
so renaming seals should be avoided if possible.

Priority is mandatory if more than one seal is specified.  Priority tells Vault
the order in which to try seals during unseal (least priority first), 
in the case more than one seal can unwrap a seal wrapped value, the order
in which to attempt decryption, and which order to attempt to source entropy
for entropy augmentation.  This can be useful if your seals have different
performance or cost characteristics.

All configured, healthy seals are used to seal wrap values.  When seals are 
unhealthy, Vault keeps track of values that could not be fully wrapped and
will re-wrap them once seals become healthy again.  Disabled seals can still
be used for decryption of wrapped values, but will be avoided when
encrypting values.

To add an additional seal, simply add another seal stanza, specifying priority
and optionally name, and restart Vault.

To remove a seal, remove the corresponding seal stanza and restart.  There must
be at least one seal remaining.

It is highly recommended to take a snapshot of your Vault storage before applying 
any seal configuration change.

Once Vault unseals with the new seal configuration, it will be available to process
traffic even as re-wrapping proceeds.

### Safety checks

Vault will reject seal configuration changes in the following circumstances,
as a safety mechanism:

* The old seal configuration and new seal configuration do not share one seal
in common.  This is necessary as there would be no seal capable of decrypting
CSPs or seal wrapped values previously written.

* Seal re-wrapping is in progress.  Vault must be in a clean, fully wrapped state
on the previous configuration before attempting a configuration change.

* More than one seal is being added or removed at a time.  

### Interaction with Shamir Seals

Seal HA is only supported with auto seal mechanisms.  To use Seal HA when
running a Shamir seal, first use the traditional 
[seal migration](/vault/docs/concepts/seal#seal-migration) mechanism to migrate to
an auto seal of your choice.  Afterwards you may follow the above
instructions to add a second auto seal.

Correspondingly, to migrate back to a shamir seal, first use the above
instructions to move to a single auto seal, and use the traditional
migration method to migrate back to a Shamir seal.
