# Seal High Availability

@include 'alerts/enterprise-only.mdx'

[Seal High Availability](/vault/docs/concepts/seal#seal-high-availability-enterprise)
provides the means to configure at least two auto-seals (and no more than three)
in order to have resilience against outage of a seal service or mechanism. 
Shamir seals cannot be used in a Seal HA setup.

Using Seal HA involves configuring extra seals in Vault's server configuration file
and restarting Vault or triggering a reload of it's configuration via sending
it the SIGHUP signal.

Before using Seal HA, one must have upgraded to Vault 1.16 or higher.  Seal HA is enabled
by adding the following line to Vault's configuration:

```
enable_multiseal = true
```

## Adding and Removing Seals

In order to use Seal HA, there must be more than one defined [`seal` stanza](/vault/docs/configuration/seal)
in Vault's configuration.

Seal HA adds two fields to these stanzas, `name`, and `priority`:

```hcl
seal [TYPE] {
  name = "seal_name"
  priority = "1"
  # ...
}
```

Name is optional, and if not specified is set to the type of the seal.  Names
must be unique.  If using two seals of the same type name must be specified.
Internally, name is used to disambiguate seal wrapped values in some cases,
so renaming seals should be avoided if possible.  Many seal types can use
environment variables instead of configuration lines to provide sensitive
values.  Because there may be two seals of the same type, one must
disambiguate the environment variables used.  To do this, in HA setups,
append an underscore followed by the seal's configured name (matching its
case) to any environment variable names.  For example, in the sample
configuration below, the AWS acces skey could be provided as `ACCESS_KEY_aws_east`.  
Keep in mind that the seal name must be valid in an environment variable name to use it.

Priority is mandatory if more than one seal is specified.  Priority tells Vault
the order in which to try seals during unseal (least priority first),
in the case more than one seal can unwrap a seal wrapped value, the order
in which to attempt decryption, and which order to attempt to source entropy
for entropy augmentation.  This can be useful if your seals have different
performance or cost characteristics.

Here is a hypothetical configuration for an [AWS seal](/vault/docs/configuration/seal/awskms)
compatible with Seal HA:

```hcl
seal "awskms" {
  name       = "aws_east"
  priority   = "1"

  region     = "us-east-1"
  access_key = "AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE"
  secret_key = "wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY"
  kms_key_id = "19ec80b0-dfdd-4d97-8164-c6examplekey"
}
```

All configured, healthy seals are used to seal wrap values.  This means that
for every write of a seal wrapped value or CSP, an encryption is requested
from every configured seal, and the results are stored in the storage entry.
When seals are unhealthy, Vault keeps track of values that could not be fully
wrapped and will re-wrap them once seals become healthy again. Note, however,
that it is not possible to rotate the data encryption key nor the recovery keys
while seals are unavailable. Disabled seals can still be used for decryption
of wrapped values, but will be avoided when encrypting values.

When reading a CSP or seal wrapped value, Vault will try to decrypt with the
highest priority available seal, and then try other seals on failure.

To add an additional seal, simply add another seal stanza, specifying priority
and optionally name, and restart Vault.

To remove a seal, remove the corresponding seal stanza and restart.  There must
be at least one seal remaining.

It is highly recommended to take a snapshot of your Vault storage before applying
any seal configuration change.

Once Vault unseals with the new seal configuration, it will be available to process
traffic even as re-wrapping proceeds.

Here is a partial snippet of a two seal HA setup, using an AWS KMS seal as
the primary (highest priority) seal, and a Azure KMS seal as well:

```
seal "awskms" {
  name = "AWS"
  priority = "1"
  # ...
}

seal "azurekeyvault" {
  name = "Azure"
  priority = "2"
  # ...
}
```

### Safety checks

Vault will reject seal configuration changes in the following circumstances,
as a safety mechanism:

* The old seal configuration and new seal configuration do not share one seal
in common.  This is necessary as there would be no seal capable of decrypting
CSPs or seal wrapped values previously written.

* Seal re-wrapping is in progress.  Vault must be in a clean, fully wrapped state
on the previous configuration before attempting a configuration change.

* More than one seal is being added or removed at a time.

In rare circumstances it may become impossible to update seal configuration
without triggering the safety checks. If this happens, it is possible to bypass
the checks by setting the environment variable `VAULT_SEAL_REWRAP_SAFETY` to
`disable`.

~> **Warning**: The use of environment variable `VAULT_SEAL_REWRAP_SAFETY`
should be considered as a last resort.


### Interaction with Shamir Seals

Seal HA is only supported with auto seal mechanisms.  To use Seal HA when
running a Shamir seal, first use the traditional
[seal migration](/vault/docs/concepts/seal#seal-migration) mechanism to migrate to
an auto seal of your choice.  Afterwards you may follow the above
instructions to add a second auto seal.

Correspondingly, to migrate back to a shamir seal, first use the above
instructions to move to a single auto seal, and use the traditional
migration method to migrate back to a Shamir seal.

### Removing Seal HA

Migrating back to a single seal may result in data loss if an operator does not 
use the HA seal feature. To migrate back to a single seal:

1. Perform a [seal migration](/vault/docs/concepts/seal#seal-migration) as described.
2. Monitor [`sys/sealwrap/rewrap`](/vault/docs/api-docs/system/sealwrap-rewrap) until the API returns `fully_wrapped=true`.
3. Remove `enable_multiseal` from all Vault configuration files in the cluster.
4. Restart Vault.
