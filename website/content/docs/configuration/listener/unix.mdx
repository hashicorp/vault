# Unix listener configuration

The Unix listener configures Vault to listen on the specified Unix domain socket.

```hcl
listener "unix" {
  address = "/run/vault.sock"
}
```

The `listener` stanza may be specified more than once to make Vault listen on
multiple sockets.

## `unix` listener parameters
- `address` `(string: "/run/vault.sock", <required>)` – Specifies the address to bind the Unix socket.

- `socket_mode` `(string: "", <optional>)` – Changes the access
  permissions and the special mode flags of the Unix socket.

- `socket_user` `(string: "", <optional>)` – Changes the user owner of the Unix socket.

- `socket_group` `(string: "", <optional>)` – Changes the group owner of the Unix socket.


## `unix` listener examples

### Listening on multiple sockets

This example shows Vault listening on a specified socket, as well as the default.

```hcl
listener "unix" {}

listener "unix" {
  address = "/var/run/vault.sock"
}
```

### Listening on multiple interfaces

This example shows Vault listening on TCP localhost, as well as Unix socket.

```hcl
listener "unix" {
  address = "/var/run/vault.sock"
}

listener "tcp" {
  address = "127.0.0.1:8200"
}
```

### Configuring permissions
This example shows changing access permissions and ownership of the Unix socket.
```hcl
listener "unix" {
  address = "/var/run/vault.sock"
  socket_mode = "644"
  socket_user = "1000"
  socket_group = "1000"
}
```
