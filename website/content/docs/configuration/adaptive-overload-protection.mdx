## `adaptive_overload_protection` parameters

These parameters apply to the `adaptive_overload_protection` stanza in the Vault
configuration file:

- `disable_write_controller` `(bool: <optional>)`: Disables the adaptive write
  overload controller. Defaults to `true` (controller disabled). Set
  `disable_write_controller` to `false` to enable the write controller and opt
  in to the beta functionality.
