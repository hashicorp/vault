# Aerospike configuration for Vault backend storage

The Aerospike storage backend is used to persist Vault's data in an
[Aerospike][aerospike] cluster.

- **No High Availability** – the Aerospike backend does not support high
  availability.

- **Community Supported** – the Aerospike storage backend is supported by the
  community. While it has undergone review by HashiCorp employees, they may not
  be as knowledgeable about the technology. If you encounter problems with them,
  you may be referred to the original author.

- **64-bit only** - the Aerospike storage backend is not supported when Vault runs
  on a 32-bit architecture, because the Aerospike Go client doesn't support 32-bits.

```hcl
storage "aerospike" {
  hostname = "localhost"
  port = "3000"
  namespace = "test"
  set = "vault"
  username = "admin"
  password = "admin"
}
```

## `aerospike` parameters

- `hostname` `(string: "127.0.0.1")` – Specifies the Aerospike seed hostname.

- `port` `(string: "3000")` – Specifies the Aerospike seed port.

- `hostlist` `(string: "")` – Aerospike host list, a comma separated list of potential hosts to seed the cluster.

- `namespace` `(string: "test")` – Specifies the Aerospike storage namespace.

- `set` `(string: "")` – Specifies the Aerospike storage set.

- `username` `(string: "")` – Specifies the user used to authenticate with Aerospike
  cluster. Access Control is available only in Aerospike Server Enterprise Edition.
  Leave empty for clusters running without restricted access.

- `password` `(string: "")` – Specifies the password used to authenticate with Aerospike
  cluster. Access Control is available only in Aerospike Server Enterprise Edition.
  Leave empty for clusters running without restricted access.

- `cluster_name` `(string: "")` - Specifies the expected Aerospike cluster name. If set, server nodes must return this cluster ID in order to
  join the client's view of the cluster. Should only be set when connecting to servers that
  support the "cluster-name" info command. (v3.10+)

- `auth_mode` `(string: "INTERNAL")` - Specifies the authentication mode when user/password is defined (INTERNAL/EXTERNAL).

- `timeout` `(int: 30000)` - Initial host connection timeout duration in milliseconds.

- `idle_timeout` `(int: 55000)` - Connection idle timeout in milliseconds. Every time a connection is used, its idle
  deadline will be extended by this duration. When this deadline is reached,
  the connection will be closed and discarded from the connection pool.
