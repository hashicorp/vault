  Configure Vault backend storage to use the integrated storage backend so that
  all the nodes in a Vault cluster have a replicated copy of persistent storage
  managed by the Raft consensus algorithm.

# Integrated storage (Raft) backend

The Integrated Storage backend is used to persist Vault's data. Unlike other storage
backends, Integrated Storage does not operate from a single source of data. Instead
all the nodes in a Vault cluster will have a replicated copy of Vault's data.
Data gets replicated across all the nodes via the [Raft Consensus
Algorithm][raft].

- **High Availability** – the Integrated Storage backend supports high availability.

- **HashiCorp Supported** – the Integrated Storage backend is officially supported
  by HashiCorp.

```hcl
storage "raft" {
  path = "/path/to/raft/data"
  node_id = "raft_node_1"
}
cluster_addr = "http://127.0.0.1:8201"
```

~> **Note:** When using the Integrated Storage backend, it is required to provide
[`cluster_addr`](/vault/docs/concepts/ha#per-node-cluster-address) to indicate the address and port to be used for communication
between the nodes in the Raft cluster.

~> **Note:** When using the Integrated Storage backend, a separate
[`ha_storage`](/vault/docs/configuration#ha_storage)
backend cannot be declared.

~> **Note:** When using the Integrated Storage backend, it is strongly recommended to
set [`disable_mlock`](/vault/docs/configuration#disable_mlock) to `true`, and to disable memory swapping on the system.

## `raft` parameters

- `path` `(string: "")` – The file system path where all the Vault data gets
  stored.
  This value can be overridden by setting the `VAULT_RAFT_PATH` environment variable.

- `node_id` `(string: "")` - The identifier for the node in the Raft cluster.
  You can override `node_id` with the `VAULT_RAFT_NODE_ID` environment
  variable.  When `VAULT_RAFT_NODE_ID` is unset, Vault assigns a random
  GUID during initialization and writes the value to `data/node-id` in the
  directory specified by the `path` parameter.

- `performance_multiplier` `(integer: 0)` - An integer multiplier used by
  servers to scale key Raft timing parameters, where each increment translates to approximately 1 – 2 seconds of delay. For example, setting the multiplier to "3" translates to 3 – 6 seconds of total delay.  Tuning  the multiplier affects the time it
  takes Vault to detect leader failures and to perform leader elections, at the
  expense of requiring more network and CPU resources for better performance.
  Omitting this value or setting it to 0 uses default timing described below.
  Lower values are used to tighten timing and increase sensitivity while higher
  values relax timings and reduce sensitivity.


By default, Vault uses a balanced timing value of 5, which is suitable for most
platforms and scenarios. You should only adjust the timing value when platform
telemetry indicators that a change is needed or different timing is required due
to the overall reliability your platform (network, etc.).

Setting the timing value to 1 configures Raft to its highest performance (lowest
delay) mode. The maximum allowed value is 10.

- `trailing_logs` `(integer: 10000)` - This controls how many log entries are
  left in the log store on disk after a snapshot is made. This should only be
  adjusted when followers cannot catch up to the leader due to a very large
  snapshot size and high write throughput causing log truncation before a
  snapshot can be fully installed. If you need to use this to recover a cluster,
  consider reducing write throughput or the amount of data stored on Vault. The
  default value is 10000 which is suitable for all normal workloads. The
  `trailing_logs` metric is not the same as `max_trailing_logs`.

- `snapshot_threshold` `(integer: 8192)` - This controls the minimum number of Raft
  commit entries between snapshots that are saved to disk. This is a low-level
  parameter that should rarely need to be changed. Very busy clusters
  experiencing excessive disk IO may increase this value to reduce disk IO and
  minimize the chances of all servers taking snapshots at the same time.
  Increasing this trades off disk IO for disk space since the log will grow much
  larger and the space in the `raft.db` file can't be reclaimed till the next
  snapshot. Servers may take longer to recover from crashes or failover if this
  is increased significantly as more logs will need to be replayed.

- `snapshot_interval` `(integer: 120 seconds)` - The snapshot interval
   controls how often Raft checks whether a snapshot operation is
   required. Raft randomly staggers snapshots between the configured
   interval and twice the configured interval to keep the entire cluster
   from performing a snapshot at once. The default snapshot interval is
   120 seconds.

- `retry_join` `(list: [])` - A set of connection details for another node in the
  cluster, which is used to help nodes locate a leader in order to join a cluster.
  There can be one or more [`retry_join`](#retry_join-stanza) stanzas.

  If the connection details for all nodes in the cluster are known in advance, you
  can include these stanzas to enable nodes to automatically join the Raft cluster.
  Once one of the nodes is initialized as the leader, the remaining nodes will use
  their [`retry_join`](#retry_join-stanza) configuration to locate the leader and
  join the cluster. Note that when using Shamir seal, the joined nodes will still
  need to be unsealed manually.
  See [the section below](#retry_join-stanza) for the parameters accepted by the
  [`retry_join`](#retry_join-stanza) stanza.

- `retry_join_as_non_voter` `(boolean: false)` - <EnterpriseAlert inline />
  Configures this node as a permanent non-voter. The node will not participate
  in the Raft quorum but will still receive the data replication stream
  enhancing the read throughput of the cluster. This option has the same effect
  as the [`-non-voter`](/vault/docs/commands/operator/raft#non-voter) flag for
  the `vault operator raft join` command, but only affects voting status when
  joining via `retry_join` config. You can override the non-voter configuration
  by setting the `VAULT_RAFT_RETRY_JOIN_AS_NON_VOTER` environment variable to
  any non-empty value. Configuring a node as a non-voter is only valid if there
  is at least one `retry_join` stanza.

- `max_entry_size` `(integer: 1048576)` - This configures the maximum number of
  bytes for a Raft entry. It applies to both Put operations and transactions.
  Any put or transaction operation exceeding this configuration value will cause
  the respective operation to fail. Raft has a suggested max size of data in a
  Raft log entry. This is based on current architecture, default timing, etc.
  Integrated Storage also uses a chunk size that is the threshold used for
  breaking a large value into chunks. By default, the chunk size is the same as
  Raft's max size log entry. The default value for this configuration is 1048576
  -- two times the chunking size.
  - **Note:** This option corresponds to [Consul's `kv_max_value_size` parameter](/consul/docs/agent/config/config-files#kv_max_value_size) for
    Vault clusters using a Consul storage backend.  If you are migrating from Consul
    storage to Raft Integrated Storage,  and have changed this value in Consul from its
    default to a value larger than the Integrated Storage default of 1MB, then you will
    need to make the same change in Vault's Integrated Storage config.

- `max_mount_and_namespace_table_entry_size` `(integer)`- <EnterpriseAlert
  inline /> Overrides `max_entry_size` to set a different limit for the specific
  storage entries that contain mount tables, auth tables and namespace
  configuration data. If you are reaching limits on the mount table size, you
  can use this to increase the number of mounts and namespaces that can be
  stored without the risk of other storage entries becoming too large. All other
  notes on [`max_entry_size`](#max-entry-size) apply. Before changing this, read
  the [Run Vault Enterprise
  with many namespaces](/vault/docs/enterprise/namespaces/namespace-limits) guide regarding important performance considerations.

- `autopilot_reconcile_interval` `(string: "10s")` - This is the interval after
  which autopilot will pick up any state changes. State change could mean multiple
  things; for example a newly joined voter node, initially added as non-voter to
  the Raft cluster by autopilot has successfully completed the stabilization
  period thereby qualifying for being promoted as a voter, a node that has become
  unhealthy and needs to be shown as such in the state API, a node has been marked
  as dead needing eviction from Raft configuration, etc.

- `autopilot_update_interval` `(string: "2s")` - This is the interval after which
  autopilot will poll Vault for any updates to the information it cares about. This
  includes things like the autopilot configuration, current autopilot state, raft
  configuration, known servers, latest raft index, and stats for all the known servers.
  The information that autopilot receives will be used to calculate its next state.

- `autopilot_upgrade_version` `(string: "")` - <EnterpriseAlert inline />
  Overrides the version used by Autopilot during [automated
  upgrades](/vault/docs/enterprise/automated-upgrades). Vault's build version is
  used by default. The string provided must be a valid [Semantic
  Version](https://semver.org).

- `autopilot_redundancy_zone` `(string: "")` - <EnterpriseAlert inline />
  Specifies a [redundancy zone](/vault/docs/enterprise/redundancy-zones) which
  is used by Autopilot to automatically swap out failed servers for enhanced
  reliability.

<Warning title="Experimental">

- `raft_wal` `(boolean: false)` - Enables the
  [write-ahead](/vault/docs/internals/integrated-storage#configurable-raft-log-store)
  log store instead of the default of BoltDB.

- `raft_log_verifier_enabled` `(boolean: false)` - Enables the raft log verifier.
  The verifier periodically writes small raft logs and verifies checksums to 
  ensure that data has been written correctly. The verifier works with raft
  write-ahead **and** BoltDB log stores.

- `raft_log_verification_interval` `(string: "60s")` - Sets the interval at
  which the raft log verifier write verification logs. The default interval is
  `60s` and the minimum supported interval is `10s`. The `raft_log_verification_interval`
  parameter has no effect if `raft_log_verifier_enabled` is `false`.

</Warning>

### `retry_join` stanza

- `leader_api_addr` `(string: "")` - Address of a possible leader node.

- `auto_join` `(string: "")` - Cloud auto-join configuration, using
  [go-discover](https://github.com/hashicorp/go-discover) syntax.

- `auto_join_scheme` `(string: "")` - The optional URI protocol scheme for addresses
  discovered via auto-join. Available values are `http` or `https`.

- `auto_join_port` `(uint: "")` - The optional port used for addressed discovered
  via auto-join.

- `leader_tls_servername` `(string: "")` - The TLS server name to use when
  connecting with HTTPS.
  Should match one of the names in the [DNS
  SANs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subject_Alternative_Name) of the remote
  server certificate.
  See also [Integrated Storage and TLS](/vault/docs/concepts/integrated-storage#autojoin-with-tls-servername)

- `leader_ca_cert_file` `(string: "")` - File path to the CA cert of the
  possible leader node.

- `leader_client_cert_file` `(string: "")` - File path to the client certificate
  for the follower node to establish client authentication with the possible
  leader node.

- `leader_client_key_file` `(string: "")` - File path to the client key for the
  follower node to establish client authentication with the possible leader node.

- `leader_ca_cert` `(string: "")` - CA cert of the possible leader node.

- `leader_client_cert` `(string: "")` - Client certificate for the follower node
  to establish client authentication with the possible leader node.

- `leader_client_key` `(string: "")` - Client key for the follower node to
  establish client authentication with the possible leader node.

Each [`retry_join`](#retry_join-stanza) block may provide TLS certificates via
file paths or as a single-line certificate string value with newlines delimited
by `\n`, but not a combination of both. Each [`retry_join`](#retry_join-stanza)
stanza may contain either a [`leader_api_addr`](#leader_api_addr) value or a
cloud [`auto_join`](#auto_join) configuration value, but not both. When an
[`auto_join`](#auto_join) value is provided, Vault will automatically attempt to
discover and resolve potential Raft leader addresses using [go-discover](https://github.com/hashicorp/go-discover).
See the go-discover
[README](https://github.com/hashicorp/go-discover/blob/master/README.md)
for details on the format of the `auto_join` value.

By default, Vault will attempt to reach discovered peers using HTTPS and port 8200. Operators may override these through the
[`auto_join_scheme`](#auto_join_scheme) and [`auto_join_port`](#auto_join_port)
fields respectively.

Example Configuration:

```hcl
storage "raft" {
  path    = "/Users/foo/raft/"
  node_id = "node1"

  retry_join {
    leader_api_addr = "http://127.0.0.2:8200"
    leader_ca_cert_file = "/path/to/ca1"
    leader_client_cert_file = "/path/to/client/cert1"
    leader_client_key_file = "/path/to/client/key1"
  }
  retry_join {
    leader_api_addr = "http://127.0.0.3:8200"
    leader_ca_cert_file = "/path/to/ca2"
    leader_client_cert_file = "/path/to/client/cert2"
    leader_client_key_file = "/path/to/client/key2"
  }
  retry_join {
    leader_api_addr = "http://127.0.0.4:8200"
    leader_ca_cert_file = "/path/to/ca3"
    leader_client_cert_file = "/path/to/client/cert3"
    leader_client_key_file = "/path/to/client/key3"
  }
  retry_join {
    auto_join = "provider=aws region=eu-west-1 tag_key=vault tag_value=... access_key_id=... secret_access_key=..."
  }
}
```
