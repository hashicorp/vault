# Swift configuration for Vault backend storage

The Swift storage backend is used to persist Vault's data in an
[OpenStack Swift Container][swift].

- **No High Availability** – the Swift storage backend does not support high
  availability.

- **Community Supported** – the Swift storage backend is supported by the
  community. While it has undergone review by HashiCorp employees, they may not
  be as knowledgeable about the technology. If you encounter problems with them,
  you may be referred to the original author.

```hcl
storage "swift" {
  auth_url  = "https://..."
  username  = "admin"
  password  = "secret123!"
  container = "my-storage-container"
}
```
