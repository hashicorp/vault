# CouchDB configuration for Vault backend storage

The CouchDB storage backend is used to persist Vault's data in
[CouchDB][couchdb] table.

- **No High Availability** – the CouchDB backend does not support high
  availability.

- **Community Supported** – the CouchDB storage backend is supported by the
  community. While it has undergone review by HashiCorp employees, they may not
  be as knowledgeable about the technology. If you encounter problems with them,
  you may be referred to the original author.
