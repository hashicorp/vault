# File system configuration for Vault backend storage

The Filesystem storage backend stores Vault's data on the filesystem using a
standard directory structure. It can be used for durable single server
situations, or to develop locally where durability is not critical.

- **No High Availability** – the Filesystem backend does not support high
  availability.

- **HashiCorp Supported** – the Filesystem backend is officially supported by
  HashiCorp.

```hcl
storage "file" {
  path = "/mnt/vault/data"
}
```

Even though Vault's data is encrypted at rest, you should still take appropriate
measures to secure access to the filesystem.

## `file` parameters

- `path` `(string: <required>)` – The absolute path on disk to the directory
  where the data will be stored. If the directory does not exist, Vault will
  create it.

## `file` examples

This example shows the Filesystem storage backend being mounted at
`/mnt/vault/data`.

```hcl
storage "file" {
  path = "/mnt/vault/data"
}
```
