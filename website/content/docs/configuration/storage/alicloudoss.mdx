# Alicloud OSS configuration for Vault backend storage

The Alicloud OSS storage backend is used to persist Vault's data in
an [Alicloud OSS][alicloudoss] bucket.

- **No High Availability** – the Alicloud OSS storage backend does not support
  high availability.

- **Community Supported** – the Alicloud OSS storage backend is supported by the
  community. While it has undergone review by HashiCorp employees, they may not
  be as knowledgeable about the technology. If you encounter problems with them,
  you may be referred to the original author.
