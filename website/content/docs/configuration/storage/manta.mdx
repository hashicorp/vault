# Manta Object Storage configuration for Vault backend storage

The Manta storage backend is used to persist Vault's data in [Triton's Manta Object
Storage][manta-object-store]. The storage folder must already exist.

- **No High Availability** – the Manta storage backend does not support high
  availability.

- **Community Supported** – the Manta storage backend is supported by the
  community. While it has undergone review by HashiCorp employees, they may not
  be as knowledgeable about the technology. If you encounter problems with them,
  you may be referred to the original author.

```hcl
storage "manta" {
  directory   = "manta-directory"
  user = "myuser"
  key_id = "40:9d:d3:f9:0b:86:62:48:f4:2e:a5:8e:43:00:2a:9b"
}
```

## `manta` parameters

- `directory` `(string: <required>)` – Specifies the name of the manta directory to use.
  This will be in the `/stor/` folder in the specific manta account

The following settings are used for authenticating to Manta.

- `user` `(string: <required>)` – Specifies the Manta user account name. This can also be provided via
  the environment variable `MANTA_USER`.

- `key_id` `(string: <required>)` – The fingerprint of the public key of the SSH key pair to use for authentication with the Manta API.
  It is assumed that the SSH agent has the private key corresponding to this key ID loaded. This can also be provided
  via the environment variable `MANTA_KEY_ID`.

- `subuser` - The name of a subuser that has been granted access to the Manta account. This can also be
  provided via the environment variable `MANTA_SUBUSER`.
- `url` – Specifies the Manta URL. Defaults to `https://us-east.manta.joyent.com`. This can also be provided via
  the environment variable `MANTA_URL`.

- `max_parallel` `(string: "128")` – Specifies The maximum number of concurrent
  requests to Manta.

## `manta` examples

This example shows configuring the Azure storage backend with a custom number of
maximum parallel connections.

```hcl
storage "manta" {
  directory    = "vault-storage-directory"
  max_parallel = 512
}
```
