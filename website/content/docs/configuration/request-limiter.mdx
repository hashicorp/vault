  The Request Limiter mitigates overload scenarios in Vault by adaptively
  limiting in-flight requests based on latency measurements.

# `request_limiter`

@include 'alerts/enterprise-only.mdx'

<Warning title="Deprecated beta feature">

Vault 1.16 included the request limiter as a Beta feature. During the beta, we
found an alternative approach that better meets user needs.  The request limiter
has been deprecated in favor of [adaptive overload
protection](/vault/docs/concepts/adaptive-overload-protection).

</Warning>

The `request_limiter` stanza allows operators to turn on the adaptive
concurrency limiter, which is off by default. This is a reloadable config.

```hcl
request_limiter {
  disable = false
}
```

~> **Warning** This feature is still in Tech Preview. Turning the Request
Limiter *on* may have negative effects on request success rates. Please test
your workloads before turning this on in production.
