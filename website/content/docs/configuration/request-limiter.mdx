page_title: Request Limiter - Configuration
description: |-
  The Request Limiter mitigates overload scenarios in Vault by adaptively
  limiting in-flight requests based on latency measurements.
---

# `request_limiter`

@include 'alerts/enterprise-only.mdx'

@include 'alerts/beta.mdx'

The `request_limiter` stanza allows operators to turn on the adaptive
concurrency limiter, which is off by default. This is a reloadable config.

```hcl
request_limiter {
  disable = false
}
```

~> **Warning** This feature is still in Tech Preview. Turning the Request
Limiter *on* may have negative effects on request success rates. Please test
your workloads before turning this on in production.
