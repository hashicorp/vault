# `kms_library` stanza

The `kms_library` stanza isolates platform specific configuration for managed keys.
It defines logical names that are referenced within an API configuration keeping cluster
and node specific details separated along with deployment concerns for each.

At the moment managed keys are only available as a feature set within Vault Enterprise HSM edition.

## Requirements

The following software packages are required for Vault Enterprise HSM:

- PKCS#11 compatible HSM integration library. Vault targets version 2.2 or
  higher of PKCS#11. Depending on any given HSM, some functions (such as key
  generation) may have to be performed manually.
- The [GNU libltdl
  library](https://www.gnu.org/software/libtool/manual/html_node/Using-libltdl.html)
  â€” ensure that it is installed for the correct architecture of your servers

## Configuration

Multiple kms_library stanza's can be defined with the only limitation that the value for the
name key needs to be a unique value across all the stanza definitions in a case-insensitive
manner.

The type argument only supports "pkcs11" at the moment.

Example `kms_library` stanza:

```hcl
kms_library [TYPE] {
  name = "<logical name>"
  # ...
}
```

## `pkcs11` parameters

These parameters apply to the `kms_library` stanza of type `pkcs11` in the Vault configuration file:

- `name` `(string: <required>)`: The logical name to be referenced by a managed key
- `library` `(string: <required>)`: The path to the PKCS#11 library shared object file.

For example:

```hcl
kms_library "pkcs11" {
  name = "hsm1"
  library = "/usr/lib/Cryptoki.so"
}
```
