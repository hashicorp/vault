# Identity-based rate limit quotas

As the number of Vault client applications increases, the incoming requests to
Vault can degrade Vault's performance. The issue is often caused by
applications that are:

- Generating an unbounded number of leases and/or loading too much data into
  Vault leading to exhausting storage backend's available memory
- Consuming an erroneously large amount of bandwidth leading to internal
  throttling of the Vault cluster as a whole

Use [rate limit quotas](/vault/docs/configuration/create-lease-count-quota) and
[lease count quotas](/vault/docs/configuration/create-rate-limit-quota) to
protect your Vault environment's stability and network, as well as storage
resource consumption from runaway application behavior and distributed denial of
service (DDoS) attack.


Vault Enterprise permits organizations to define more fine-grained rate limits
to how traffic enters their Vault cluster. Identity-based rate limit quotas use
`group_by` options to create buckets for requests.

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th style={{verticalAlign: 'middle'}}>Group_by option</th>
      <th style={{verticalAlign: 'middle'}}>Description</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>

  <tr>
    <td><code>ip</code></td>
    <td>
      Creates buckets based on the IP addresses. (Default)
    </td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td><code>entity_then_none</code></td>
    <td>
     Groups requests on namespace, mount, or path by entity ID. The rate applies to the each bucket created. Requests
     without associated entity ID are handled by a collective secondary quota.
    </td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td><code>entity_then_ip</code></td>
    <td>
      Groups requests on namespace, mount, or path by entity ID. The rate applies to the each bucket created. Requests without associated entity ID are bucketed by IP, and the rate applies to each bucket. This option is recommended if your organization has reliably mappable IPs.
    </td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td><code>secondary_rate</code></td>
    <td>
      Allows organizations to set a separate rate for entity ID.<br/><br/>
    </td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td><code>none</code></td>
    <td>
      Creates one bucket for the namespace, path, or mount and collectively limits all traffic to that target.
    </td>
  </tr>


  </tbody>
</table>


**Example:** The command below creates a rate limit quota with rate of 1000
requests per second with `group_by` is set to `entity_then_none`, and the
secondary rate is 2000 requests per second.

```shell-session
$ vault write sys/quotas/rate-limit/my-rate \
    rate=1000 \
    group_by=entity_then_none \
    secondary_rate=2000     
```

The `group_by` option supplements the existing quota features.
