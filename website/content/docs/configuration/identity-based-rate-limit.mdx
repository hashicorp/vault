# Rate limit quotas - collective, by IP, by entity

As the number of Vault client applications increases, the incoming requests to
Vault can degrade Vault's performance. To protect your Vault environment's
stability and network, as well as storage resource consumption from runaway
application behavior and distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack, use [rate
limit quotas](/vault/docs/configuration/create-lease-count-quota) and [lease
count quotas](/vault/docs/configuration/create-rate-limit-quota).

The rate limit quotas enforce API rate limiting using a [token
bucket](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Token_bucket) algorithm. For Vault
Enterprise clusters, the rate limit quota supports a **`group_by`** option to
define a group of requests based on the characteristic they have in common, and
put them in the same bucket. 

The available `group_by` modes are:

- `ip` - groups requests by their source IP address (_Default_)

- `none` - groups together all requests that match the rate limit quota rule

- `entity_then_ip` - groups requests by their entity ID for authenticated
  requests that carry one, or by their IP for unauthenticated requests (or
  requests whose authentication is not connected to an entity)

- `entity_then_none` - groups requests by their entity ID when available, but
  the rest is all grouped together (for example, unauthenticated requests, and
  requests with authentication that is not connected to an entity)

The `group_by` option with `entity_then_ip` or `entity_then_none` mode allows
you to set a secondary rate limit (**`secondary_rate`**). This rate limit applies to
the requests that fall under the `ip` or `none` groupings, while the
authenticated requests that contain an entity ID are subject to the primary rate
limit set by the `rate` parameter.

**Example:**

The command below creates a rate limit quota with rate of 1,000 requests per
second with `group_by` mode is `entity_then_none`, and the secondary rate is
2,000 requests per second.

```shell-session
$ vault write sys/quotas/rate-limit/my-rate \
    rate=1000 \
    group_by=entity_then_none \
    secondary_rate=2000     
```

The `entity_then_none` or `entity_then_ip` mode groups requests based on their
attached entity. This helps when your organization has:

- many workloads using the same IP
- single workloads using many IPs which may scale up or down
- dynamic IPs that change frequently

The group by `none` option creates one bucket for all requests at the designated
level (namespace, mount, or path) for that rate limit. For example, if your
organization provides Vault as a service to your customers, you segregate the
customers each into their own namespace. The default behavior of any rate limit
set for the namespace creates a bucket per IP. If the desired behavior is to set
a collective rate limit for all entities and workloads coming into the
namespace, the `none` option can achieve that.

## Rate limit quota precedence

You can define quotas on namespaces, mounts, and paths. If the path is an auth
mount with a concept of roles (such as `/auth/approle/`), the rate limit quota
restricts login requests to that mount with the specified role. 

Only one rate limit quota rule can exist for any given path, and the most
granular rate limit quota takes effect on the requests. 

To understand which rate limit quota rule applies to a request, here is the
order of precedence:

1. The rate limit quota matching the target namespace, mount, and role
1. The rate limit quota matching the target namespace, mount, and path
1. The rate limit quota matching the target namespace, mount, and the longest
   prefix of the target path that ends with a trailing glob (*)
1. The rate limit quota matching the target namespace, and mount
1. The rate limit quota matching the target namespace
1. The rate limit quota matching the closest parent namespace, as long as the
   match has the `inheritable` field set
1. Global rate limit quota


## Resource quota best practices

The `group_by` option supplements the existing quota features.

- Use [Terraform Vault
  provider](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/vault/latest/docs/resources/quota_rate_limit)
  to configure and implement quotas instead of making API calls.

- Define at least one lease count quota to protect your Vault cluster from
  [lease explosions](/vault/docs/configuration/prevent-lease-explosions).

- Configure low limits at the namespace level, and higher limits at the specific
problematic path. The most granular rate limit quotas takes the effect.
