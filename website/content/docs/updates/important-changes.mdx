# Important changes

Always review important or breaking changes and remediation recommendations
before upgrading Vault.

## Transit support for Ed25519ph and Ed25519ctx signatures ((#ed25519))

| Change       | Affected version | Affected deployments
| ------------ | ---------------- | --------------------
| New behavior | 1.19.0           | Transit plugins using Ed25519 keys

Prior versions of sign and verify API endpoints backed by an Ed25519 key ignored
`prehashed=true` or `hash_algorithm=sha2-512` parameters. As a result, the
endpoint always returned or verified a Pure Ed25519 signature.

The Transit plugin now assumes input hashed using the SHA-512 algorithm and
returns an Ed25519ph or Pure Ed25519 signature based on the configuration of
`prehashed` and `hash_algorithm` parameters:

| Vault edition | `prehashed` | `hash_algorithm`              | Return value
| ------------- | ----------  | ---------------------------   | ------------
| Enterprise    | not set     | not set                       | Pure Ed25519
| Enterprise    | false       | any value other than sha2-512 | Pure Ed25519
| Enterprise    | false       | sha2-512                      | Error
| Enterprise    | true        | any value other than sha2-512 | Error
| Enterprise    | true        | sha2-512                      | Ed25519ph
| CE            | not set     | not set                       | Pure Ed25519
| CE            | false       | any value other than sha2-512 | Pure Ed25519
| CE            | false       | sha2-512                      | Error
| CE            | true        | any value other than sha2-512 | Error
| CE            | true        | sha2-512                      | Error


## Identity system duplicate cleanup ((#dedupe)) <EnterpriseAlert inline="true" />

| Change       | Affected version | Affected deployments
| ------------ | ---------------- | --------------------
| New behavior | 1.19.0           | any

Vault 1.19.0 includes a feature flag that, when enabled, forces deduplication of
existing identities and forbids duplicate identities going forward. Once
activated, the deduplication feature corrects historical identity bugs with a
one-time deduplication process and restores Vault to secure, default behavior.

Vault does not enforce deduplication until you activate the relevant feature
flag.

### Recommendation

Vault 1.19.0 also includes improved reporting in server logs to help diagnose
whether you have duplicate identities in your Vault instance. 

After upgrading, review your server logs for identity duplicate reporting.

refer to the [resolve duplicate identities](/vault/docs/secrets/identity/deduplication)
guides to understand deduplication log messages, determine if you need to take
action, make the necessary updates, and ensure the forced deduplication process
resolves safely.


## LDAP user DN search with `upndomain` ((#ldap))

| Change   | Affected version | Affected deployments
| -------- | ---------------- | --------------------
| Breaking | 1.19.x           | any

Security improvements to
[`hashicorp/cap/ldap`](https://github.com/hashicorp/cap/tree/main/ldap) ensure
that user DN searches with `upndomain` configured return an error if the search
returns more than one result. 

### Recommendation

In previous Vault versions, DN searches with `upndomain` configured returned the
last user found for searches with multiple results. Review and update any code
that performs DN searches to handle multi-result errors and/or revise the search
to ensure a single result.

Refer to [the Github PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/cap/pull/151) for more
details.


## Duplicate unseal/seal wrap HSM keys ((#hsm-keys)) <EnterpriseAlert inline="true" />

| Change      | Affected version               | Affected deployments
| ----------- | ------------------------------ | --------------------
| Known issue | 1.19.x, 1.18.x, 1.17.x, 1.16.x | HSM-HA configurations migrating from Shamir to HSM-backed unseal/seal wraps.

Vault may create duplicate HSM keys when you migrate from Shamir to an
HSM-backed unseal configuration for high availability (HA) HSM deployments. Key
duplication can happen even after a seal migration to HSM that initially
appears successful.

Duplicate HSM keys can cause the following errors:

- intermittent read failures with errors such as `CKR_SIGNATURE_INVALID` and `CKR_KEY_HANDLE_INVALID` for
[seal-wrapped values](/vault/docs/enterprise/sealwrap#wrapped-parameters).
- nodes fail to unseal after a restart with errors such as `CKR_DATA_INVALID`.

### Recommendation

Always run Vault with `generate_key = false` and manually create all required
keys within the HSM during the setup process.


## Anonymized cluster data returned with license utilization ((#anon-data)) <EnterpriseAlert inline="true" />

| Change       | Affected version | Affected deployments
| ------------ | ---------------- | --------------------
| New behavior | 1.19.0           | any

As of version 1.19.0 Vault Enterprise collects
[anonymous usage data](/vault/docs/enterprise/license/product-usage-reporting#anonymous-product-usage-reporting)
about the running Vault cluster and automatically sends the cluster usage data
along with the standard utilization data currently reported through automated
license reporting.


## RADIUS authentication is no longer case sensitive ((#case-sensitive))

| Change       | Affected version | Affected deployments
| ------------ | ---------------- | --------------------
| New behavior | 1.19.0           | any

As of Vault 1.19.0 the RADIUS authentication plugin does not enforce case
sensitivity on entered credentials.


## Login/token renewal failures after group changes ((#group-writes))

| Change      | Affected version | Affected deployments
| ----------- | ---------------- | --------------------
| Known issue | 1.19.0           | any

Performance standby nodes cannot persist updated group membership to storage.
As a result, standby nodes return a `500` error during login or token renewal if
the external group associated with the client entity changes. 

### Recommendation

Direct all logins and token renewals to the active/primary node.


## Strict validation for Azure auth login requests ((#strict-azure))

| Change       | Affected version                 | Affected deployments
| ------------ | -------------------------------- | --------------------
| New behavior | 1.19.1, 1.18.7, 1.17.14, 1.16.18 | any

Azure auth plugin requires `resource_group_name`, `vm_name`, and `vmss_name` to match the JWT claims on login

Vault versions before 1.19.1, 1.18.7, 1.17.14, and 1.16.18 did not strictly
validate the `resource_group_name`, `vm_name`, and `vmss_name` parameters
against their token claims for clients logging in with Azure authentication.

### Recommendation

Review the [Token validation](/vault/docs/auth/azure#token-validation) section
of the Azure authN plugin guide for more information on the new validation
requirements.


## Static LDAP role rotations on upgrade ((#ldap-static-role-rotations))

| Change       | Affected version                                                       | Affected deployments
| ------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------
| Known issue  | 1.19.0 - 1.19.1, 1.18.5 - 1.18.7, 1.17.12 - 1.17.14, 1.16.16 - 1.16.18 | any

Vault automatically rotates existing static roles tied to LDAP credentials once
when upgrading to an affected version. After the one-time rotation, the static
roles behave as expected.

### Recommendation

If you rely on LDAP static roles, upgrade to Vault 1.19.2+, 1.18.8+, 1.17.15+,
or 1.16.19+.


## Static DB role rotations on upgrade ((#db-static-role-rotations))

| Change       | Affected version  | Affected deployments
| ------------ | ----------------- | --------------------
| Known issue  | 1.14.x or earlier | any

When upgrading from Vault version 1.14.x or earlier, Vault automatically rotates
existing static roles tied to database credentials once when upgrading to an
affected version. After the one-time rotation, the static roles behave as
expected.

### Recommendation

If you rely on database static roles, avoid directly upgrading to the following
Vault versions:

- 1.19.0 - 1.19.2
- 1.18.5 - 1.18.8
- 1.17.12 - 1.17.15
- 1.16.16 - 1.16.19


## Vault log file missing subsystem logs ((#missing-logs))

| Change       | Affected version                 | Affected deployments
| ------------ | -------------------------------- | --------------------
| Bug          | 1.16.0, 1.17.13, 1.18.6, 1.19.0  | any

Log entries, including plugin logs, for Vault deployments using `log_file` do
not capture all relevant information even though the information appears as
expected in standard error and standard output.

### Recommendation

Upgrade to one of the following Vault versions: 1.16.1+, 1.17.14+, 1.18.7+,
1.19.1+


## Automated rotation stops after unseal ((#rotation-stops))

| Change       | Affected version | Affected deployments
| ------------ | ---------------- | --------------------
| Bug          | 1.19.0 - 1.19.2  | any

After unsealing Vault, the rotation manager does not reinstate the rotation
queue. The stopped queue then causes automated root credential rotations to
stop.

### Recommendation

Update the root configuration on affected backends to recreate the rotation
schedule with the previous values.

<Tabs>
<Tab heading="AWS">

```shell-session
$ vault write aws/config/root          \
    rotation_schedule="<old_schedule>" \
    rotation_window="<old_window>"
```

</Tab>
<Tab heading="GCP">

```shell-session
$ vault write gcp/config/root rotation_period="<old_period>"
```

</Tab>
</Tabs>


## Azure Auth fails to authenticate Uniform VMSS instances ((#azure-vmss))

| Change       | Affected version                     | Affected deployments
| ------------ | ------------------------------------ | --------------------
| Bug          | 1.16.18+, 1.17.14+, 1.18.7+, 1.19.1+ | any

A previous update to validate JWT claims against the provided VM, VMSS, and
resource group names without accounting for the uniform VMSS format introduced a
regression that causes Azure authentication from a uniform VMSS instance with a
user assigned managed identity on the VMSS to incorrectly return an error.

### Recommendation 

Avoid upgrading until we fix the issue.
