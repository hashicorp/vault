# Vault Secrets Operator telemetry

The Vault Secrets Operator is instrumented with Prometheus metrics in the following ways:
* The operator will emit the default controller-runtime metrics as outlined in the [monitoring](https://book-v1.book.kubebuilder.io/beyond_basics/controller_metrics.html)
* Custom metrics related to the operator internals which are defined in [`internal/metrics/metrics.go`](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault-secrets-operator/blob/main/internal/metrics/metrics.go)
* Ability to deploy a Prometheus Service Monitor, configured via the Helm Chart [`telemetry`](/vault/docs/platform/k8s/vso/helm#h-telemetry) stanza.
* Ability to deploy a Metrics Service, configured via the Helm Chart [`metricsService`](/vault/docs/platform/k8s/vso/helm#h-metricsservice) stanza.
