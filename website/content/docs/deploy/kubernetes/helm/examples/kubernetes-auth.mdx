# Bootstrapping Kubernetes auth method

@include 'helm/version.mdx'

In this example, we will walk through how to set up the [Kubernetes Auth Method](/vault/docs/auth/kubernetes).

This assumes the following commands will be run inside a Vault pod running in Kubernetes.

Exec into the Vault pod:

```bash
kubectl exec -it vault-0 -- /bin/sh
```

If you didn't set `server.dev.enabled=true`, you'll need to log in to Vault first using `vault login`.
Then run the following commands to configure the Kubernetes Auth Method:

```bash
vault auth enable kubernetes
vault write auth/kubernetes/config \
    kubernetes_host=https://$KUBERNETES_SERVICE_HOST:$KUBERNETES_SERVICE_PORT
```

From here you can continue to configure Vault from the [Kubernetes Auth Method](/vault/docs/auth/kubernetes) documentation.
