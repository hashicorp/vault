# Standalone server with load balanced UI

@include 'helm/version.mdx'

The below `values.yaml` can be used to set up a single server Vault cluster with a LoadBalancer to allow external access to the UI and API.

```yaml
server:
  standalone:
    enabled: true
    config: |
      ui = true

      listener "tcp" {
        tls_disable = 1
        address = "[::]:8200"
        cluster_address = "[::]:8201"
      }
      storage "file" {
        path = "/vault/data"
      }

  service:
    enabled: true

  dataStorage:
    enabled: true
    size: 10Gi
    storageClass: null
    accessMode: ReadWriteOnce

ui:
  enabled: true
  serviceType: LoadBalancer
```
