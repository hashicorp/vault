  Learn how to set up a highly available Vault cluster with integrated storage (Raft) as the storage backend.

# Highly available Vault cluster with integrated storage (Raft)

@include 'helm/version.mdx'

Integrated storage (raft) can be enabled using the `server.ha.raft.enabled` value:

```shell
helm install vault hashicorp/vault \
  --set='server.ha.enabled=true' \
  --set='server.ha.raft.enabled=true'
```

Next, initialize and unseal `vault-0` pod:

```shell
kubectl exec -ti vault-0 -- vault operator init
kubectl exec -ti vault-0 -- vault operator unseal
```

Finally, join the remaining pods to the Raft cluster and unseal them. The pods
will need to communicate directly so we'll configure the pods to use the internal
service provided by the Helm chart:

```shell
kubectl exec -ti vault-1 -- vault operator raft join http://vault-0.vault-internal:8200
kubectl exec -ti vault-1 -- vault operator unseal

kubectl exec -ti vault-2 -- vault operator raft join http://vault-0.vault-internal:8200
kubectl exec -ti vault-2 -- vault operator unseal
```

To verify if the Raft cluster has successfully been initialized, run the following.

First, login using the `root` token on the `vault-0` pod:

```shell
kubectl exec -ti vault-0 -- vault login
```

Next, list all the raft peers:

```shell
$ kubectl exec -ti vault-0 -- vault operator raft list-peers

```

Vault with Integrated Storage (Raft) is now ready to use!
