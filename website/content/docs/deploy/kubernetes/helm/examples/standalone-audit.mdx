# Standalone server with audit storage

@include 'helm/version.mdx'

The below `values.yaml` can be used to set up a single server Vault cluster with
auditing enabled.

```yaml
server:
  standalone:
    enabled: true
    config: |
      listener "tcp" {
        tls_disable = true
        address = "[::]:8200"
        cluster_address = "[::]:8201"
      }

      storage "file" {
        path = "/vault/data"
      }

  service:
    enabled: true

  dataStorage:
    enabled: true
    size: 10Gi
    storageClass: null
    accessMode: ReadWriteOnce

  auditStorage:
    enabled: true
    size: 10Gi
    storageClass: null
    accessMode: ReadWriteOnce
```

After Vault has been deployed, initialized and unsealed, auditing can be enabled
by running the following command against the Vault pod:

```shell-session
$ kubectl exec -ti <POD NAME> --  vault audit enable file file_path=/vault/audit/vault_audit.log
```
