# Highly available Vault cluster with Consul

@include 'helm/version.mdx'

@include 'consul-dataplane-compat.mdx'

The below `values.yaml` can be used to set up a five server Vault cluster using
Consul as a highly available storage backend, Google Cloud KMS for Auto Unseal.

```yaml
server:
  extraEnvironmentVars:
    GOOGLE_REGION: global
    GOOGLE_PROJECT: myproject
    GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS: /vault/userconfig/my-gcp-iam/myproject-creds.json

  volumes:
    - name: userconfig-my-gcp-iam
      secret:
        defaultMode: 420
        secretName: my-gcp-iam

  volumeMounts:
    - mountPath: /vault/userconfig/my-gcp-iam
      name: userconfig-my-gcp-iam
      readOnly: true
