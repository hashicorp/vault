# Run Vault on AWS

You can deploy Vault on Amazon Web Services (AWS) with the official HashiCorp
[AWS Marketplace offering of HCP Vault](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/prodview-arpkegbgk6zfy?sr=0-6&ref_=beagle&applicationId=AWSMPContessa).

<Note>

HashiCorp no longer releases Vault as Amazon Machine Images (AMIs).
