# Verified protocols

To support a variety of use cases, Vault verifies protocol implementation and
integrations with partner products, appliances, and applications that support
advanced data protection features.

## IPv6 validation and compliance ((#ipv6))

[Vault Enterprise supports IPv6](https://www.hashicorp.com/trust/compliance/vault-enterprise)
in compliance with OMB Mandate M-21-07 and Federal IPv6 policy requirements
for the following operating systems and storage backends.

**Self-attested testing covers functionality related to HSM, FIPS 140-3, and
HSM/FIPS 140-3.**

## OS validation

<Note title="IPv6 limitations for Windows">

  IPv6 does not work with external plugins (plugins not built into Vault) when
  running on Windows in server mode because they default to IPv4 and Vault
  cannot override that behavior.

</Note>

## Backend storage validation

Backend storage system  | Validation    | Vault version
----------------------- | ------------- | -----------------------
Consul                  | N/A           | Untested
Integrated Raft storage | Self-attested | ent-1.18+
