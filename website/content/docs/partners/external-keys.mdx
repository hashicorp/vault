# Verified external key partners

To support a variety of use cases, Vault verifies protocol implementation and
integrations with partner products, appliances, and applications that support
advanced data protection features.

@include 'alerts/partner-program.mdx'

## External key management (EKMS)

Vault centrally manages and automates encryption keys across environments so
customers can [manage external encryption keys](/vault/docs/secrets/key-management)
used in third party services and products with the following plugins:

Abbreviation | Full plugin name
------------ | ----------------
EKMMSSQL     | [Vault EKM provider for SQL server](/vault/docs/platform/mssql)
KV           | [Key/Value secrets engine](/vault/docs/secrets/kv)
KMSE         | [Key Management secrets engine](/vault/docs/secrets/key-management)
KMIP         | [KMIP secrets engine](/vault/docs/secrets/kmip)
PKCS#11      | [PKCS#11 provider](/vault/docs/enterprise/pkcs11-provider)
Transit      | [Transit secrets engine](/vault/docs/secrets/transit)

<Note title="Vault verified vs HCP Vault verified">

  HCP Vault verified integrations work with the current version HCP Vault
  Dedicated. Self-managed Vault instances must meet the required minimum version
  for verification guarantees.

</Note>

## Verified integrations

The table below indicates the plugin support for partner products, the
verification status for HCP Vault Dedicated and the minimum Vault version
required for verified behavior in self-managed Vault instances:
