# Vault server temporarily overloaded

Vault returns a `503 - Service Unavailable` response to indicate that a request
was rejected after Vault has reached its in-flight request capacity:

```
Error making API request.

URL: PUT https://127.0.0.1:61555/v1/auth/userpass/login/foo
Code: 503. Errors:

* 1 error occurred:
	* Vault server temporarily overloaded
```

`503 - Service Unavailable` is a retryable HTTP error, which is handled
internally by the Vault API.

~> **NOTE**:  `429 - Too Many Requests` is typically used to indicate that a
specific client is issuing too many requests. The choice of `503 - Service
Unavailable` for request rejection emphasizes that that the server is
temporarily under excess load, which may not be related to a specific client.

For more information on request rejection, refer to the [Request
Limiter](/vault/docs/concepts/request-limiter) documentation.
