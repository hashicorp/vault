  How to handle Vault servers rejecting requests due to overload.
---

Vault Enterprise includes features for [Adaptive Overload
Protection](/vault/docs/concepts/adaptive-overload-protection). When some server
resource is at capacity, Vault Enterprise may reject some HTTP client requests
to preserve the Vault server's ability to remain stable and available. This
document described considerations for handling these requests in client code.

# Vault server temporarily overloaded

Vault returns a `503 - Service Unavailable` response to indicate that a request
was rejected because there was not enough capacity to service it in a timely way:

```
Error making API request.

URL: PUT https://127.0.0.1:61555/v1/auth/userpass/login/foo
Code: 503. Errors:

* 1 error occurred:
	* Vault server temporarily overloaded
```

`503 - Service Unavailable` is a retryable HTTP error.

Vault clients should retry their request with a suitable backoff strategy.
When retrying you should:
 * Wait for an increasing amount of time between retries.
 * Randomize the wait time between retries to avoid many clients becoming
   synchronized and all retrying at the same moment. This is often called
   adding "jitter".
 * Limit the total number of retries so that request volume doesn't continue to
   grow for the duration of an outage as more and more clients add on retries.

~> **NOTE**:  `429 - Too Many Requests` is typically used to indicate that a
specific client is issuing too many requests. A `503 - Service Unavailable`
instead indicates that that the server is under excess load, which is likely to
be unrelated to the behavior of the specific client being rejected.

For more information on request rejection, refer to the [Adaptive Overload
Protection Overview](/vault/docs/concepts/adaptive-overload-protection).

## API Package

For clients written in Go that use Vault's API package, retries are handled by
default with no further work needed.
