## Policies

To subscribe to an event notification, you must have the following policy grants:

1. `read` capability on `/v1/sys/events/subscribe/{eventType}`, where `{eventType}` is the event type that will be
subscribed to. The path may contain wildcards.

An example blanket policy is:
```hcl
path "sys/events/subscribe/*" {
    capabilities = ["read"]
}
   ```

2. `list` and `subscribe` capabilities on the *path of the secret* for events
related to secrets. The policy must also provide a `subscribe_event_types`
entry with the specific event notifications subscribers are allowed to use. For example,
to receive event notifications related to the KV secrets engine path,
`secret/my-data`, a valid policy would be:

```hcl
path "secret/my-data" {
  capabilities = ["list", "subscribe"]
  subscribe_event_types = ["*"]
}
   ```
