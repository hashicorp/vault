## Precedence

The precedence for user lockout configuration is as follows:

Configuration for "all" auth methods in config file >> Default values.

The precedence for user lockout disable is as follows:

The user lockout configuration for the auth method at a given path can be tuned using auth tune. Please see [auth tune command](/vault/docs/commands/auth/tune)
