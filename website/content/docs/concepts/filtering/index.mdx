# Filter expressions

Filter expressions can be used by various parts of Vault to provide useful
functionality. This page describes the overall syntax; see the sub-pages for
information on the specific values available for filtering for various features,
including examples.

Each filter expression has matching operators composed with selectors and
values.

## Create expressions

A single expression is a matching operator with a selector and value. They are
written in plain text format, and Boolean logic and parenthesization are
supported. In general whitespace is ignored, except within literal strings.

### Matching operators

All matching operators use a selector or value to choose what data should be
matched. Each endpoint that supports filtering accepts a potentially different
list of selectors and is detailed in the API documentation for those endpoints.

```text
// Equality & Inequality checks
<Selector> == "<Value>"
<Selector> != "<Value>"

// Emptiness checks
<Selector> is empty
<Selector> is not empty

// Contains checks or Substring Matching
"<Value>" in <Selector>
"<Value>" not in <Selector>
<Selector> contains "<Value>"
<Selector> not contains "<Value>"

// Regular Expression Matching
<Selector> matches "<Value>"
<Selector> not matches "<Value>"
```

### Selectors

Selectors are used by matching operators to create an expression. Inputs to
filter expressions are JSON (or JSON-derived); selectors therefore use [JSON
Pointer](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6901) to select values from the input.
Each selector must be enclosed in quotes and contain a valid JSON Pointer path,
including leading slash (`/`).

```text
// Selects the value `zipzap` from the input `{ "foo": { "bar": "zipzap" } }`
"/foo/bar"
```

### Values

Values are used by matching operators to create an expression. Values can be any
valid selector, a number, or a string. It is best practice to quote values.

Numbers can be base 10 integers or floating point numbers.

When quoting strings, they may either be enclosed in double quotes or backticks.
When enclosed in backticks they are treated as raw strings and escape sequences
such as `\n` will not be expanded.

## Connect expressions

There are several methods for connecting expressions, including

- Logical `or`
- Logical `and`
- Logical `not`
- Grouping with parenthesis
- Matching expressions

```text
// Logical Or - evaluates to true if either sub-expression does
<Expression 1> or <Expression 2>

// Logical And - evaluates to true if both sub-expressions do
<Expression 1 > and <Expression 2>

// Logical Not - evaluates to true if the sub-expression does not
not <Expression 1>

// Grouping - Overrides normal precedence rules
( <Expression 1> )

// Inspects data to check for a match
<Matching Expression 1>
```

Standard operator precedence can be expected for the various forms. For example,
the following two expressions would be equivalent.

```text
<Expression 1> and not <Expression 2> or <Expression 3>

( <Expression 1> and (not <Expression 2> )) or <Expression 3>
```

## Performance

Filters are executed on Vault nodes and therefore will consume some amount
of CPU time on the node.

<Note title="Regular expressions">
  Using multiple/complex expressions including regular expressions
  (regex) will have a larger impact on performance than fewer/simpler filters.
</Note>

We recommend that all filters are tested in pre-production environments in order
to ensure correctness.

Ideally you should [codify your management of Vault](/vault/tutorials/operations/codify-mgmt-vault-terraform)
using tools such as [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/), to prevent accidentally enabling an audit device
in a production environment with untested/incorrect settings.

Finally, always ensure you profile production-like workloads within your pre-production
environments in order to accurately assess the performance of Vault.
