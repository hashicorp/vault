# Filtering audit entries

This page describes how to use filters with Vault audit devices to fine tune which
audit entries should be written to an audit log.

Starting in Vault 1.16.0, audit devices can be enabled with a `filter` option, which
is used to evaluate audit entries and determine if they should be written to a particular
audit log. Please ensure you are familiar with the [filtering concept](/vault/docs/concepts/filtering) before
attempting to configure an audit device with a filter.

Audit devices with and without filtering configured will all function simultaneously
in Vault. Using a filtered audit device does not restrict Operators from *only* using
the filter and fallback type devices described on this page.

<Note title="Advanced audit feature">
  The use of filtering in Vault's audit system should be considered an advanced feature.
  Whilst it has been designed to be simple and flexible, exclusively enabling filtered
  devices without a fallback configured could result in some requests and responses that are not audited.
</Note>

Please see the [Vault security model](/vault/docs/internals/security) for further
information about how all requests and responses to Vault are usually audited.


## `filter` option

All audit device types ([file](/vault/docs/audit/file), [socket](/vault/docs/audit/socket)
and [syslog](/vault/docs/audit/syslog)) support the `filter` option at the time they
are enabled. After successfully enabling a device with a filter, every audit entry
that Vault sends to that audit device will be compared to the expression in the filter.
Only audit entries that match the filter will be written to the device's audit log.

### Valid `filter` properties

Filters can **only** reference the following properties of an audit entry:

* `mount_point` - Path to the mount (e.g. [auth method](/vault/docs/auth), [secret engine](/vault/docs/secrets)),
including namespaces.
* `mount_type` - Type of mount being interacted with.
* `namespace` - [Namespace](/vault/docs/enterprise/namespaces) 'path' that the request is taking place within.
* `operation` - [Operation](/vault/docs/glossary#operation) being performed.
* `path` - Full path of the request.

### Example filters

The following are examples that could be supplied as a `filter` value.

| Purpose                                                                                | Filter                                  |
|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| Only persist audit entries for requests within `ns1`                                   | `namespace == ns1`                      |
| Only persist audit entries for requests that are **not** in the root namespace         | `namespace != \"\"`                     |
| Only persist audit entries that interact with `kv` engines                             | `mount_type == kv`                      |
| Only persist audit entries that attempt to perform `read` operations                   | `operation == read`                     |
| Only persist audit entries for requests that interact with `kv` within namespace `ns2` | `namespace == ns2 and mount_type == kv` |

### Scenario: `kv` only

A Vault Operator wants only `kv` type audit entries to be written to an audit log for a particular device.

1. Enable an audit device with the following filter option:

    ```
    vault audit enable -path kv-only file file_path=/var/audit.log filter="mount_type == kv"
    ```

2. List the enabled audit devices:

    ```
    vault audit list --detailed
    ```

3. Enable a `kv` secrets engine:

    ```
    vault secrets enable -path my-kv kv-v2
    ```

4. Write secret data to the `kv` engine:

    ```
    vault kv put my-kv foo=bar
    ```

5. Disable the audit device:

    ```
    vault audit disable -path kv-only
    ```

The steps above performed a number of actions against Vault that generate audit entries.
However, only two of them had a `mount_type` of `kv` (steps 3 and 4).

Viewing the contents of the file audit log at `/var/audit.log` will show that only audit
entries related to steps 3 and 4, with a request and response audit entry for each.

### Test message

When enabling an audit device, Vault will (by default) attempt to send a test message
to the device. In cases where filtering is configured on a device, it may be possible
for the evaluation of the filter to result in the test message failing to meet the specified
predicate expression, and therefore not being written to the audit device's sink. This test
message will always be present in `fallback` devices (described below).

The properties of the test message are as follows:

* `mount_point` - not present
* `mount_type` - not present.
* `namespace` - not present.
* `operation` - `update`.
* `path` - `sys/audit/test`.

Vault Operators should use this when trying to understand when they should or
should not expect a test message to appear in the sink for a newly enabled audit device.

## Fallback device

The ability to filter audit entries can provide great flexibility to your workflows,
however the additional complexity can make it possible for a Vault Operator to configure their
audit devices in such a way that some audit entries are missed out from audit logs entirely.
Therefore, we strongly encourage you to test out audit configurations in your non-production
environments before deploying them to production.

The `fallback` audit device is the (non-mandatory) mechanism by which Vault can
continue to adhere to Vault's [security model](/vault/docs/internals/security),
that all requests and responses are successfully logged before the client receives
any secret material.

When exclusively using filtered audit devices, enable the fallback audit device to
catch any audit entries that would otherwise be missed.

This means Vault is able to provide the same guarantee that 'at least one device must
successfully write an audit entry' as when only standard/non-filtered audit devices
are enabled.

<Note title="Single fallback device">
  Vault supports enabling only a single fallback audit device.
</Note>

#### Enabling the fallback audit device

[Enabling the fallback audit device](/vault/docs/audit#fallback) requires supplying the `fallback` option:

```shell-session
vault audit enable -path=my-fallback -description="fallback device" file file_path=/tmp/audit.fallback.log fallback=true
```

### Metrics

When the fallback device is enabled, and required to persist an audit entry to the audit log,
Vault will emit a [fallback 'success' metric](/vault/docs/internals/telemetry/metrics/audit#vault-audit-fallback-success) on
a successful write to the audit log.

If audit devices are enabled that make use of filtering, but no fallback audit device
has been enabled, Vault will produce a [fallback 'miss' metric](/vault/docs/internals/telemetry/metrics/audit#vault-audit-fallback-miss)
as a way to allow Operators to understand how many auditable Vault entries are not
being persisted to their audit logs.
