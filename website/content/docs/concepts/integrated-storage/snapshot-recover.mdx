# Item recovery from a snapshot

@include 'alerts/enterprise-only.mdx'

## Overview

With Vault Enterprise you can recover individual items from an integrated
storage snapshot without needing to restore your entire cluster to the state in
the snapshot.

Item recovery is a two-step process:

1. Load a snapshot into Vault so Vault can access the data and assign a snapshot
   ID.
1. Use that snapshot ID to read, list, and recover individual paths from the
   snapshot.

## Supported Paths

Not all paths support snapshot operations. The following paths are currently supported:

| Plugin    | Path            | Snapshot operations supported | Vault version |
|-----------|-----------------|-------------------------------|---------------|
| cubbyhole | `/:secret_name` | `recover`, `read`, `list`     | 1.20.0        |
| kv (v1)   | `/:secret_name` | `recover`, `read`, `list`     | 1.20.0        |



## Loading snapshots

Load a snapshot using the [`vault operator raft snapshot load`](/vault/docs/commands/operator/raft#snapshot-load) command. The
snapshot can either be a file on disk or a snapshot created from Vault's
[automated snapshot](/vault/docs/enterprise/automated-integrated-storage-snapshots) feature
and stored in cloud storage.

Vault will return you information about the loaded snapshot, including a `snapshot_id`
which you will reference to perform operations from the snapshot. Vault sets the
initial status of the loaded snapshot to `loading`, indicating that it is extracting
the data within the snapshot and preparing it for use. Once Vault fully loads the
snapshot, it updates the status to `ready`. You can query your loaded snapshot at the API
endpoint [`sys/storage/raft/snapshot-load/:snapshot_id`](/vault/api-docs/system/storage/raftsnapshotload#read-loaded-snapshot).

If something goes wrong during the loading process, Vault will set the status of
the loaded snapshot to `error` and return a new field called `error` describing
the problem. Snapshots with an `error` status cannot be used for any snapshot operations.

@include 'recover/loadedsnapshots.mdx'

### Replication

Performance primaries and performance secondaries can each load their own snapshots.
However, a performance secondary will not be able to perform snapshot operations
on any shared paths. Performance secondaries can only perform snapshot operations
on paths corresponding to local mounts.

Disaster recovery secondaries cannot load snapshots.

## Snapshot operations

Once you have loaded a snapshot, you can specify the snapshot ID read, list, and
recover operations.

To read a secret at a specific path from the snapshot:
```shell
$ vault read -snapshot-id <snapshot_id> secret/my-secret
```

To list the secrets at a specific path from the snapshot:
```shell
$ vault list -snapshot-id <snapshot_id> secret/
```
Reading and listing use the same API endpoints as the normal read and list, but have
an extra query parameter to specify the snapshot ID. Vault will perform the operation
on the backend, but use the snapshot's stored data instead of the live data.

@include 'recover/deletedmounts.mdx'

To recover a secret at a specific path from the snapshot:
```shell
$ vault recover -snapshot-id <snapshot_id> secret/my-secret
```

To perform a recover command, Vault will first read the secret at the path from
the snapshot to retrieve the snapshot's version of the data. Then, Vault will send the
data to the plugin backend to perform the recover operation. The plugin backend
will use this data (along with potentially its own information) to create or update
the data at the specified path in live storage.

## Policies

Reading and listing from a snapshot are guarded by the same `read` and `list`
capabilities as the normal read and list operations. This means that if a user has
`read` or `list` on the path, by default they will be allowed to read or list from a
snapshot on that path.

If you would like to **disallow** reading or listing from a snapshot, you can
create a policy that denies the `read_snapshot_id` parameter. For example, to
disallow reading/listing from a snapshot on the `secrets/*` path, you can create
the policy:

```hcl
path "secrets/*" {
  capabilities = ["read", "list"]
  denied_parameters = {
    read_snapshot_id = []
  }
}
```

Users must have the `recover` capability on a path to recover that path from a
snapshot. The user does not need to have any other capabilities to allow
this operation.

```hcl
path "secrets/*" {
  capabilities = ["recover"]
}
```
