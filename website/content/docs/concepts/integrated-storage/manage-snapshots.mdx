# Manage snapshots

All Vault editions support data backup and restoration with manual snapshots of the cluster state. Vault Enterprise adds support for configurable automatic snapshots to local and cloud storage.

When you save and securely retain Vault cluster snapshots, you help defend against data corruption or sabotage. You can further support data availability in the event of catastrophic failure by retaining cluster snapshots outside cluster storage or physical datacenters where clusters operate.

This guidance provides snapshot management details, and command examples for the Vault CLI and API. Refer to the [Resources](#resources) section of this document for more details about the API endpoints and CLI commands shown in the examples.

<Tip>

If you're saving snapshots in preparation for a Vault Enterprise upgrade, review the [Automate upgrades with Vault Enterprise](/vault/tutorials/raft/raft-upgrade-automation) guide to learn how Autopilot can automate your upgrades.

</Tip>

## Prerequisites

Ensure that you carry out or understand these items **before** you try to save or restore Vault snapshots.

- **Working Vault knowledge:**
   You need some working Vault knoweldge to follow the examples. You should be familiar with using Vault with the CLI, API, or UI.

- **Valid Vault cluster configuration:**
   Your Vault cluster must have valid cluster configuration as defined in the guidance in [Vault with integrated storage reference architecture](/vault/tutorials/day-one-raft/raft-reference-architecture).

- **Vault ready for use:**
   Your Vault cluster must be in an initialized state, with keyholders available
   to enter the unseal or recovery keys. You must also have access to tokens with required capabilities to access encrypted data in the storage.

## Save a cluster snapshot

All Vault editions offer support for manually saving cluster snapshots. These example steps show how to manually take a snapshot from a Vault cluster leader node with the CLI or API.

<Note> 

Keep in mind that the exact steps needed depend on your specific Vault architecture and storage type, and can differ from the examples shown here.

## Enable automatic cluster snapshots

@include 'alerts/enterprise-only.mdx'

Vault Enterprise features configurable automatic snapshots written to local or cloud storage on an interval. Follow these steps to enable automatic snapshots.

<Tabs>

<Tab heading="Single cluster" group="single">

### Enable a single cluster automatic snapshot

These examples show how to configure automatic snapshots for a single cluster with the Vault CLI or API.

<Tabs>

<Tab heading="CLI" group="cli">

Enable automatic snapshots with the following example commands, based on the
instructions in the [automatic snapshots with integrated storage documentation](/vault/docs/enterprise/automated-integrated-storage-snapshots)
with options specified in the [API
documentation](/vault/api-docs/system/storage/raftautosnapshots#create-update-an-automated-snapshots-config).

```shell-session
$ vault write sys/storage/raft/snapshot-auto/config/[:name] [options]
```

**Example:**

The following command creates an automatic snapshot configuration named,
`testsnap` with a user defined location and interval.

```shell-session
$ vault write sys/storage/raft/snapshot-auto/config/testsnap \
     storage_type=local \
     file_prefix=testsnappy \
     interval=120m \
     retain=7 \
     local_max_space=262144000 \
     path_prefix=/opt/vault/
```

This example specifies local storage with both a filename and path prefix, a 120 minute snapshot interval, and retainins up to 7 snapshots before deleting earlier snapshots. The configuration also requires that the snapshots with the given `file_prefix` value and in the specified `path_prefix` value consume no more than 250 megabytes (262144000 bytes) of storage. If snapshots reach this value, Vault cannot write a snapshot until enough space is available.

Learn more in the [API documentation](/vault/api-docs/system/storage/raftautosnapshots#create-update-an-automated-snapshots-config).

#### Enable automatic snapshots on primary cluster

The following command creates an automatic snapshot configuration named,
`paris-primary` with a user defined location and interval.

This example specifies AWS S3 storage with appropriate AWS configuration options for the bucket name, the region, and required credentials. Snapshots are further protected with server side encryption.

```shell-session

The configuration also specifies local storage with both a filename and path prefix, a 120 minute snapshot interval, and retainins up to 7 snapshots before deleting earlier snapshots. The configuration also requires that the snapshots with the given `file_prefix` value and in the specified `path_prefix` value consume no more than 250 megabytes (262144000 bytes) of storage.

```

The configuration further defines local storage with both a filename and path prefix, a 12 hour snapshot interval, and retainins up to 14 snapshots before deleting earlier snapshots. The configuration also requires that the snapshots with the given `file_prefix` value and in the specified `path_prefix` value consume no more than 2.6 gigabytes (2621440000 bytes) of storage.

## Restore a cluster snapshot

### Restore a single cluster snapshot

Use these examples to learn how to restore a snapshot to a single Vault cluster.

<Tabs>

<Tab heading="CLI" group="cli">

1. Bring your Vault cluster back online following the circumstances that
required you to restore from backup. You must reinitialize your Vault
cluster with new storage, and authenticate with the new initial root token generated during this re-initialization. Note that this situation is temporary- you still need the original cluster unseal keys to unseal Vault after restoring the snapshot.

1. Copy your Vault snapshot file to a Vault cluster member and run the
example command, replacing the example filename with that of your snapshot file. Note that you must use the `-force` flag in this command since the Auto-unseal or Shamir keys will not be consistent with the snapshot data as you are restoring a snapshot from a different cluster.

   ```shell-session
   $ vault operator raft snapshot restore -force backup.snap
   ```

   Learn more in the [CLI documentation](/vault/docs/commands/operator/raft#snapshot-restore).

1. After restoring the snapshot, you must unseal your Vault
cluster again using a command like this example. Typically each person with a key share would execute the unseal command and pass in their key share until reaching the number of key shares required by the quroum defined in your original cluster configuration.

   ```shell-session
   $ vault operator unseal [unseal_key]
   ```

### Restore a disaster recovery replication cluster snapshot

Use these examples to learn how to restore a snapshot to a DR Replication Vault cluster.

<Tabs>

<Tab heading="CLI" group="cli">

1. Bring your Vault cluster back online following the circumstances that
required you to restore from backup. You must reinitialise your Vault
cluster with new storage, and authenticate with the new initial root token generated during this re-initialisation. Note that this situation is temporary- you still need the original cluster unseal keys to unseal Vault after restoring the snapshot.

1. Copy your Vault snapshot files for the Primary and DR replica clusters onto restored members of the respective clusters and run the following example command, replacing the example filename with that of your snapshot file. Note that you must use the `-force` flag in this command since the Auto-unseal or Shamir keys will not be consistent with the snapshot data as you are restoring a snapshot from a different cluster.

   ```shell-session
   $ vault operator raft snapshot restore -force backup.snap
   ```

   Learn more in the [CLI documentation](/vault/docs/commands/operator/raft#snapshot-restore).

1. After restoring the snapshot, you must unseal your Vault
cluster again using a command like this example. Typically each person with a key share would execute the unseal command and pass in their key share until reaching the number of key shares required by the quroum defined in your original cluster configuration.

   ```shell-session
   $ vault operator unseal [unseal_key]
   ```

## Recover a secret

@include 'alerts/enterprise-only.mdx'

Vault Enterprise features a flexible, robust, and delegatable recovery mechanism for restoring deleted or mistakenly changed secrets that prioritizes Vault cluster availability. 

Secret Recovery enables you to delegate recovery of specific individual secrets from a cluster snapshot without restoring the complete cluster state or negatively impacting the Vault cluster.
