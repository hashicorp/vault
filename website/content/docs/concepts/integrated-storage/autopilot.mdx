# Autopilot

Autopilot enables automated workflows for managing Raft clusters. The current
feature set includes 3 main features: Server Stabilization, Dead Server Cleanup
and State API. These three features are introduced in Vault 1.7.

## Server Stabilization

Server stabilization helps to retain the stability of the Raft cluster by safely
joining new voting nodes to the cluster. When a new voter node is joined to an
existing cluster, autopilot adds it as a non-voter instead, and waits for a
pre-configured amount of time to monitor it's health. If the node remains to be
healthy for the entire duration of stabilization, then that node will be
promoted as a voter. The server stabilization period can be tuned using
`server_stabilization_time` (see below).

## Dead Server Cleanup

Dead server cleanup automatically removes nodes deemed unhealthy from the
Raft cluster, avoiding the manual operator intervention. This feature can be
tuned using the `cleanup_dead_servers`, `dead_server_last_contact_threshold`,
and `min_quorum` (see below).

## State API

State API provides detailed information about all the nodes in the Raft cluster
in a single call. This API can be used for monitoring for cluster health.

### Follower Health

Follower node health is determined by 2 factors.

- Its ability to heartbeat to leader node at regular intervals. Tuned using
  `last_contact_threshold` (see below).
- Its ability to keep up with data replication from the leader node. Tuned using
  `max_trailing_logs` (see below).

### Default Configuration

By default, Autopilot will be enabled with clusters using Vault 1.7+,
although dead server cleanup is not enabled by default. Upgrade of
Raft clusters deployed with older versions of Vault will also transition to use
Autopilot automatically.

Autopilot exposes a [configuration
API](/api-docs/system/storage/raftautopilot#set-configuration) to manage its
behavior. Autopilot gets initialized with the following default values.

- `cleanup_dead_servers` - `false`

- `dead_server_last_contact_threshold` - `24h`

- `min_quorum` - This doesn't default to anything and will need to be set to at
  least 3 when `cleanup_dead_servers` is set as `true`.

- `max_trailing_logs` - `1000`

- `last_contact_threshold` - `10s`

- `server_stabilization_time` - `10s`

## Replication

Performance secondary clusters have their own Autopilot configuration, managed
independently of their primary.

DR secondary clusters will also have their own Autopilot configuration (starting
in Vault 1.8.0), managed independently of their primary. The [Autopilot
API](/api-docs/system/storage/raftautopilot) uses DR operation tokens for
authorization.
