# Autopilot

Autopilot enables automated workflows for managing Raft clusters. The current
feature set includes 3 main features: Server Stabilization, Dead Server Cleanup
and State API. These three features were introduced in Vault 1.7. The Enterprise
feature set includes 2 main features: Automated Upgrades and Redundancy Zones.
These two features were introduced in Vault 1.11.

## Server stabilization

Server stabilization helps to retain the stability of the Raft cluster by safely
joining new voting nodes to the cluster. When a new voter node is joined to an
existing cluster, autopilot adds it as a non-voter instead, and waits for a
pre-configured amount of time to monitor its health. If the node remains
healthy for the entire duration of stabilization, then that node will be
promoted as a voter. The server stabilization period can be tuned using
`server_stabilization_time` (see below).

## Dead server cleanup

Dead server cleanup automatically removes nodes deemed unhealthy from the
Raft cluster, avoiding the manual operator intervention. This feature can be
tuned using the `cleanup_dead_servers`, `dead_server_last_contact_threshold`,
and `min_quorum` (see below).

## State API

The [State API](/vault/api-docs/system/storage/raftautopilot#get-cluster-state) provides detailed information about all the nodes in the Raft cluster
in a single call. This API can be used for monitoring for cluster health.

### Follower health

Follower node health is determined by 2 factors.

- Its ability to heartbeat to leader node at regular intervals. Tuned using
  `last_contact_threshold` (see below).
- Its ability to keep up with data replication from the leader node. Tuned using
  `max_trailing_logs` (see below).

### Default configuration

By default, autopilot will be enabled with clusters using Vault 1.7+,
although dead server cleanup is not enabled by default. Upgrade of
Raft clusters deployed with older versions of Vault will also transition to use
autopilot automatically.

@include 'autopilot/config.mdx'

~> **Note**: Autopilot in Vault does similar things to what autopilot does in
[Consul](https://www.consul.io/). However, the configuration in these 2 systems
differ in terms of default values and thresholds; some additional parameters
might also show up in Vault in comparison to Consul as well. Autopilot in Vault
and Consul use different technical underpinnings requiring these differences, to
provide the autopilot functionality.

## Automated upgrades

[Automated Upgrades](/vault/docs/enterprise/automated-upgrades) lets you automatically upgrade a cluster of Vault nodes to a new version as
updated server nodes join the cluster. Once the number of nodes on the new version is
equal to or greater than the number of nodes on the old version, autopilot will promote
the newer versioned nodes to voters, demote the older versioned nodes to non-voters,
and initiate a leadership transfer from the older version leader to one of the newer
versioned nodes. After the leadership transfer completes, the older versioned non-voting
nodes can be removed from the cluster.

## Redundancy zones

[Redundancy Zones](/vault/docs/enterprise/redundancy-zones) provide both scaling and resiliency benefits by deploying non-voting
nodes alongside voting nodes on a per availability zone basis. When using redundancy zones,
each zone will have exactly one voting node and as many additional non-voting nodes as desired.
If the voting node in a zone fails, a non-voting node will be automatically promoted to
voter. If an entire zone is lost, a non-voting node from another zone will be promoted to voter,
maintaining quorum. These non-voting nodes function not only as hot standbys, but also
increase read scalability.

## Replication

DR secondary and Performance secondary clusters have their own autopilot configurations, managed
independently of their primary.

The [Autopilot API](/vault/api-docs/system/storage/raftautopilot) uses DR operation tokens for
authorization when executed against a DR secondary cluster.
