# Lease count quota exceeded

Vault returns a `429 - Too Many Requests` response if a new lease request
violates the quota limit, to guard against [lease
explosions](/vault/docs/concepts/lease-explosions).

The error will appear as follows:

```
Error making API request.

URL: PUT https://127.0.0.1:61555/v1/auth/userpass/login/foo
Code: 429. Errors:

* 1 error occurred:
	* request path "auth/userpass/login/foo": lease count quota exceeded
```

To resolve the error:

1. Check for client-side errors that result in excessive lease creation and
   correct them.
1. Tune your lease count quota to accommodate any expected increases in lease
   creation. For example, due to new feature releases or an increase in users.
