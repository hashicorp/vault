# Events

-> **Important:** Events are experimental, and may have backwards incompatible changes introduced in subsequent versions of Vault, or be removed altogether.

Events are arbitrary, **non-secret** data that can be exchanged between producers (Vault and plugins)
and subscribers (Vault components and external users via the API).
Events are delivered on a *best-effort* basis, so do not have delivery guarantees at this time.

As of Vault 1.13, events are not considered production-ready, and so are disabled by default when starting a Vault server.
Events can be enabled via the `events.alpha1` [experiment flag](/vault/docs/configuration#experiments) in the Vault
configuration or on the command-line:

```shell-session
$ vault server -experiment events.alpha1
```

~> Note: Experiments can only be enabled at startup, and cannot be disabled or enabled at runtime.

## Event Types

<!-- This information will probably be migrated to the plugin pages eventually -->

Internal components of Vault as well as external plugins can generate events.
These are published to "event types", sometimes called "topics" in some event systems.
All events of a specific event type will have the same format for their
additional `metadata` field.

The following events are currently supported generated by Vault and its builtin plugins automatically:

| Plugin | Event Type              | Vault version |
| ------ | ----------------------- | ------------- |
| kv     | `kv-v1/delete`          | 1.13          |
| kv     | `kv-v1/write`           | 1.13          |
| kv     | `kv-v2/config-write`    | 1.13          |
| kv     | `kv-v2/data-delete`     | 1.13          |
| kv     | `kv-v2/data-patch`      | 1.13          |
| kv     | `kv-v2/data-write`      | 1.13          |
| kv     | `kv-v2/delete`          | 1.13          |
| kv     | `kv-v2/destroy`         | 1.13          |
| kv     | `kv-v2/metadata-delete` | 1.13          |
| kv     | `kv-v2/metadata-patch`  | 1.13          |
| kv     | `kv-v2/metadata-read`   | 1.13          |
| kv     | `kv-v2/metadata-write`  | 1.13          |
| kv     | `kv-v2/undelete`        | 1.13          |


## Event Format

Events may be formatted in protobuf binary format or as JSON.
See `EventReceived` in [`sdk/logical/event.proto`](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/blob/main/sdk/logical/event.proto) in the relevant Vault version for the protobuf schema.

- `event` `(Event)` - contains the event that happened.

  - `id` `(string)` - unique identifier for the event. The `id` is unique for each event, and events with the same `id` represent the same event.

  - `metadata` `(object)` - arbitrary extra data customized for the event type.

- `eventType` `(string)` - the event type that was published.

- `pluginInfo` `(PluginInfo)` - information about the plugin that generated the event, if applicable.

  - `mountClass` `(string)` - the class of plugin, e.g., `secret`, `auth`.

  - `mountAccessor` `(string)` - the unique ID of the mounted plugin.

  - `mountPath` `(string)` - the path that the plugin is mounted at.

  - `plugin` `(string)` - the name of the plugin, e.g., `kv`.

- `timestamp` `(string)` - ISO 8601-formatted timestamp for when the event was generated.

Here is an example event in JSON format:

```json
{
    "event": {
        "id": "827e2cc0-6ace-42f1-2517-409616ce1fbc",
        "metadata": {
            "current_version": "2",
            "oldest_version": "0",
            "path": "data/secure123"
        }
    },
    "eventType": "kv-v2/data-write",
    "pluginInfo": {
        "mountClass": "secret",
        "mountAccessor": "kv_6dd6f6c6",
        "mountPath": "secret/",
        "plugin": "kv"
    },
    "timestamp": "2023-02-16T21:57:34.719199Z"
}
```

## Subscribing to Events

Vault has an API endpoint, `/v1/sys/events/subscribe/{eventType}`, that allows users to subscribe to events via a
WebSockets stream.
This endpoint supports the standard authenticaion and authorization workflows used by other Vault endpoints.
The `{eventType}` parameter is a non-empty string of what event type to subscribe, which may contain wildcards (`*`)
to subscribe to multiple events, e.g., `kv-v2/data-*`.

By default, the events delivered in protobuf binary format.
The endpoint can also format the data as JSON if the `json` query parameter is set to `true`:

```shell-session
$ wscat -H "X-Vault-Token: $(vault print token)" --connect 'ws://127.0.0.1:8200/v1/sys/events/subscribe/kv-v2/data-write?json=true
{"event":{"id":"827e2cc0-6ace-42f1-2517-409616ce1fbc", "metadata":{"current_version":"2", "oldest_version":"0", "path":"data/secure123"}}, "eventType":"kv-v2/data-write", "pluginInfo":{"mountClass":"secret", "mountAccessor":"kv_6dd6f6c6", "mountPath":"secret/", "plugin":"kv"}, "timestamp":"2023-02-16T21:57:34.719199Z"}
...
```

The Vault CLI support this endpoint via the `events subscribe` command, which will output a stream of
JSON for the requested events (one line per event):

```shell-session
$ vault events subscribe kv-v2/data-write
{"event":{"id":"827e2cc0-6ace-42f1-2517-409616ce1fbc", "metadata":{"current_version":"2", "oldest_version":"0", "path":"data/secure123"}}, "eventType":"kv-v2/data-write", "pluginInfo":{"mountClass":"secret", "mountAccessor":"kv_6dd6f6c6", "mountPath":"secret/", "plugin":"kv"}, "timestamp":"2023-02-16T21:57:34.719199Z"}
...
```

A small number of events may be stored temporarily in Vault and replayed when a subscriber first connects.

## Policies

To subscribe, the `read` capability must be granted by a [policy](/vault/docs/concepts/policies)
on the `/v1/sys/events/subscribe/{eventType}` path, where `{eventType}` is the event type that will be
subscribed to. The path may contain wildcards.

An example blanket policy is:
```hcl
path "sys/events/subscribe/*" {
    capabilities = ["read"]
}
```
