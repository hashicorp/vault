description: An overview of license autoloading.

Prior to Vault 1.8, Vault Enterprise would be licensed using special binaries
that contained embedded licenses, or via a license written into Vault storage
using the `PUT sys/license` API.

As of Vault 1.8 those options still exist but are deprecated, and the recommended
mechanism for managing licenses is called License Autoloading.  New clusters are
required to use the autoloading method.

License Autoloading can be done using one of these mechanisms, in increasing order
of priority (i.e. `VAULT_LICENSE` takes precedence over `VAULT_LICENSE_PATH`, which
takes precedence over `license_path` in config.)
* [license_path in config](/docs/configuration#license_path)
* [VAULT_LICENSE_PATH environment variable](/docs/commands#vault_license_path)
* [VAULT_LICENSE environment variable](/docs/commands#vault_license)

Each node needs to be licensed, they should all use the same license string, and
they should all use autoloading or none should. Warnings will be written to
the log when there are discrepancies.

If autoloading is used any existing stored license will be ignored.  The presence
of a stored license in conjunction with autoloaded license will also result in
logged warnings.  Having migrated to autoloading, it is recommended to use
the [DELETE API](/docs/system/license#delete-license) to remove the stored license.
