# Automated License utilization reporting

Automated license utilization reporting sends license utilization data to
HashiCorp without requiring you to manually collect and report them. It also
lets you review your license usage with the monitoring solution you already use
(for example Splunk, Datadog, or others) so you can optimize and manage your
deployments. Use these reports to understand how much more you can deploy under
your current contract, protect against overutilization, and budget for predicted
consumption.  

Automated reporting shares the minimum data required to validate license
utilization as defined in our contracts. They consist of mostly computed metrics
and will never contain Personal Identifiable Information (PII) or other
sensitive information. Automated reporting shares the data with HashiCorp using
a secure, unidirectional HTTPS API and makes an auditable record in the product
logs each time it submits a report.

## Enable automated reporting

To enable automated reporting, you need to make sure that outbound network
traffic is configured correctly and upgrade your enterprise product to a version
that supports it. If your installation is air-gapped or network settings are not
in place, automated reporting will not work. 

### 1. Allow outbound HTTPS traffic on port 443

Make sure that your network allows HTTPS egress on port 443 from
https://reporting.hashicorp.services by allow-listing the following IP
addresses: 

- 100.20.70.12
- 35.166.5.222
- 23.95.85.111
- 44.215.244.1

### 2. Upgrade

Upgrade to a release that supports entitlement utilization reporting. These
releases include:

- [Vault Enterprise 1.14.0](https://releases.hashicorp.com/vault/) and later


### 3. Check logs

Automatic license utilization reporting will start sending data within 24 hours.
Check the product logs for records that the data sent successfully.

Instructions on how to check logs.

```

</CodeBlockConfig>

If your installation is air-gapped or your network doesn’t allow the correct
egress, logs will show an error. 

<CodeBlockConfig hideClipboard>

```
[DEBUG] reporting: beginning snapshot export
[DEBUG] reporting: creating payload
[DEBUG] reporting: marshalling payload to json

[DEBUG] reporting: sending request
[DEBUG] reporting: performing request: method=POST url=https://census.license.hashicorp.services
[DEBUG] reporting: error status code received: statusCode=403
```

</CodeBlockConfig>

In this case, reconfigure your network to allow egress and check back in 24
hours. 

## Opt out

If your installation is air-gapped or you want to manually collect and report on
the same license utilization metrics, you can opt-out of automated reporting. 

Manually reporting these metrics can be time consuming. Opting out of automated
reporting does not mean that you also opt out from sending license utilization
metrics. Customers who opt out of automated reporting will still be required to
manually collect and send license utilization metrics to HashiCorp. 

If you are considering opting out because you’re worried about the data, we
strongly recommend that you review the [example payloads](#example-payloads)
before opting out. If you have concerns with any of the automatically-reported
data please bring them to your account manager. 

You have two options to opt out of automated reporting: 

- HCL configuration (recommended) 
- Environment variable (requires restart)

Opting out in your product’s configuration file doesn’t require a system
restart, and is the method we recommend. Add the following block to your server
configuration file (e.g. `vault-config.hcl`).

```hcl
reporting {
	license {
		enabled = false
   }
}
```

If you need to, you can also opt out using an environment variable, which will
provide a startup message confirming that you have disabled automated reporting.
This option requires a system restart. 

Set the following environment variable.

```shell-session
$ export OPTOUT_LICENSE_REPORTING=true
```

Now, restart your [Vault servers](/vault/docs/commands/server).

Check your product logs 24 hours after opting out to make sure that the system
isn’t trying to send reports. 

If your configuration file and environment variable differ, the environment
variable setting will take precedence.

## Example payloads

HashiCorp collects the following utilization data as JSON payloads:
