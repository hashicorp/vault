# Vault enterprise HSM behavioral changes

@include 'alerts/enterprise-and-hcp-plus.mdx'

This page contains information about the behavioral differences that take
effect when using Vault with an HSM.

## Key split between unseal keys and recovery keys

Normally, Vault uses a single set of unseal keys to perform both decryption of
the cryptographic barrier and to authorize recovery operations, such as the
[`generate-root`](/vault/api-docs/system/generate-root)
functionality.

When using an HSM, because the HSM automatically unseals the barrier but
recovery operations should still have human oversight, Vault instead uses two
sets of keys: unseal keys and recovery keys. 

-> **Recovery keys:** Refer to the
 [Seal/Unseal](/vault/docs/concepts/seal#recovery-key) documentation to learn more
 about recovery keys.

## Unseal (Root) key

Vault usually generates a root key and splits it using [Shamir's Secret
Sharing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shamir%27s_Secret_Sharing) to prevent a
single operator from being able to modify and unseal Vault (see more
information about Vault's security model
[here](/vault/docs/internals/security)).

When using an HSM, Vault instead stores the root key, encrypted by the HSM,
into its internal storage. As a result, during an `init` command, the number of
key shares, threshold, and stored shares are required to be set to `1`, meaning
to not split the root key, so that the single key share is itself the root
key. (Vault does not do this automatically as it generally prefers to error
rather than change parameters set by an operator.)

Both rekeying the root key and rotation of the underlying data
encryption key are supported when using an HSM.

## Performance and availability

When an HSM is used for generating various Critical Security Parameters (CSPs) or for entropy augmentation,
interaction with the HSM becomes part of the request processing for
functionality using it. This means the HSM must be online and available for
those requests to succeed. Additionally, some operations are performed much
more frequently than key generation where interaction with the HSM may
impact performance. A mount with seal wrapping enabled will interact with
the HSM on every write for example. Vault tokens (non-batch) generated with
entropy augmentation enabled will interact with the HSM when created.
