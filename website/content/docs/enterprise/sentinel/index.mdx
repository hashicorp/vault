# Vault Enterprise and Sentinel integration

@include 'alerts/enterprise-and-hcp-plus.mdx'

Vault Enterprise integrates HashiCorp Sentinel to provide a rich set of access
control functionality. Because Vault is a security-focused product trusted with
high-risk secrets and assets, and because of its default-deny stance,
integration with Vault is implemented in a defense-in-depth fashion. This takes
the form of multiple types of policies and a fixed evaluation order.

## Policy types

Vault's policy system has been expanded to support three types of policies:

- `ACLs` - These are the [traditional Vault
  policies](/vault/docs/concepts/policies) and remain unchanged.

- `Role Governing Policies (RGPs)` - RGPs are Sentinel policies that are tied
  to particular tokens, Identity entities, or Identity groups. They have access
  to a rich set of controls across various aspects of Vault.

- `Endpoint Governing Policies (EGPs)` - EGPs are Sentinel policies that are
  tied to particular paths instead of tokens. They have access to as much
  request information as possible, but they can take effect even on
  unauthenticated paths, such as login paths.

Not every unauthenticated path supports EGPs. For instance, the paths related
to root token generation cannot support EGPs because it's already the mechanism
of last resort if, for instance, all clients are locked out of Vault due to
misconfigured EGPs.

Like with ACLs, [root tokens](/vault/docs/concepts/tokens#root-tokens)
are not subject to Sentinel policy checks.

Sentinel execution should be considered to be significantly slower than normal
ACL policy checking. If high performance is needed, testing should be performed
appropriately when introducing Sentinel policies.

### Policy enforcement levels

Sentinel policies have three enforcement levels to choose from.

| Level          | Description                                                                 |
| -------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| advisory       | The policy is allowed to fail. Can be used as a tool to educate new users.  |
| soft-mandatory | The policy must pass unless an [override](#policy-overriding) is specified. |
| hard-mandatory | The policy must pass.                                                       |

## Policy evaluation

Vault evaluates incoming requests against policies of all types that are
applicable.

1. If the request is unauthenticated, skip to evaluating the EGPs. Otherwise,
   evaluate the token's ACL policies. These must grant access; as always, a
   failure to be granted capabilities on a path via ACL policies denies the
   request.
2. Evaluate RGPs attached to the client token. All policies must pass according
   to their enforcement level.
3. Evaluate EGPs set on the requested path, and any prefix-matching EGPs set on
   less-specific paths, are evaluated. All policies must pass according to their
   enforcement level.

Any failure at any of these steps results in a denied request.

### RGPs and namespaces

Policies, auth methods, secrets engines, and tokens are locked into the
[namespace](/vault/docs/enterprise/namespaces) they are created in. However,
identity groups can pull in entities and groups from other namespaces.

<Tip>

Refer to the [Set up entities and groups section of the Secure Multi-Tenancy
with Namespaces
tutorial](/vault/tutorials/enterprise/namespaces#set-up-entities-and-groups) for
a step-by-step instruction.

</Tip>

Consider the following scenario. 

The training namespace is a child namespace of the education namespace. The "Sun
Shine" entity created in the education namespace is a member of the "Tester"
group which is defined in the training namespace. The group members inherit the
group-level policy.

While ACL policies and EGPs set rules on a specific path, an RGP does not
specify a target path. RGPs are tied to tokens, identity entities, or identity
groups that you can write rules without specifying a path.

What if the deny-all RGP in the training namespace looked like:

<CodeBlockConfig filename="deny-all.sentinel">

```hcl
precond = rule {
   identity.entity.metadata.org_id is "A012345X"
}

main = rule when precond {
   false
}
```

</CodeBlockConfig>

Vault checks the requesting token's entity metadata. If the `org_id` metadata
exists and the value is `A012345X`, the request gets denied because the
enforcement level is hard-mandatory. It does not matter if the request invokes a
path starts with `/education` or `/education/training`, or even `/foo` because
there is no path associated with the deny-all RGP.


## Policy overriding

Vault supports normal Sentinel overriding behavior. Requests to override can be
specified on the command line via the `policy-override` flag or in HTTP
requests by setting the `X-Vault-Policy-Override` header to `true`.

Override requests are visible in Vault's audit log; in addition, override
requests and their eventual status (whether they ended up being required) are
logged as warnings in Vault's server logs.

## MFA

Sentinel policies support the [Identity-based MFA
system](/vault/docs/enterprise/mfa) in Vault Enterprise. Within a single
request, multiple checks of any named MFA method will only trigger
authentication behavior for that method once, regardless of whether its
validity is checked via ACLs, RGPs, or EGPs.

EGPs can be used to require MFA on otherwise unauthenticated paths, such as
login paths. On such paths, the request data will perform a lookahead to try to
discover the appropriate Identity information to use for MFA. It may be
necessary to pre-populate Identity entries or supply additional parameters with
the request if you require more information to use MFA than the endpoint is
able to glean from the original request alone.

# Using Sentinel

## Configuration

Sentinel policies can be configured via the `sys/policies/rgp/` and
`sys/policies/egp/` endpoints; see [the
documentation](/vault/api-docs/system/policies) for more information.

Once set, RGPs can be assigned to Identity entities and groups or to tokens
just like ACL policies. As a result, they cannot share names with ACL policies.

When setting an EGP, a list of paths must be provided specifying on which paths
that EGP should take effect. Endpoints can have multiple distinct EGPs set on
them; all are evaluated for each request. Paths can use a glob character (`*`)
as the last character of the path to perform a prefix match; a path that
consists only of a `*` will apply to the root of the API. Since requests are
subject to an EGPs exactly matching the requested path and any glob EGPs
sitting further up the request path, an EGP with a path of `*` will thus take
effect on all requests.
