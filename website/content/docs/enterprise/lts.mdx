# Long-term support for Vault

@include 'alerts/enterprise-only.mdx'

Long-term support (LTS) eases upgrade requirements for installations that cannot
upgrade frequently, quickly, or easily.

## Who should consider long-term support?

Vault upgrades are challenging, especially for sensitive or critical workflows,
extensive integrations, and large-scale deployments. Strict upgrade policies
also require significant planning, testing, and employee hours to execute
successfully. 

Customers who need assurances that their current installation will receive
critical bug fixes and security patches with minimal service disruptions should
consider moving to a Vault version with long-term support.

<a id="what" />

## What is long-term support?

**Standard support** for Vault includes:

- performance improvements.
- feature updates and improvements.
- bug fixes.
- security patches.
- CVE patches to correct vulnerabilities and exposures.

Standard support covers "N&minus;2" versions, which means, at any given time,
HashiCorp supports the current version ("N") and the two previous versions
("N&minus;2").

Vault versions typically update 3 times per calendar year, which means that
standard support for a given Vault version lasts approximately 1 year:

Version | Release date         | Standard support ends
------- | -------------------- | ----------------------
1.16    | CY24 Q1 (2024-03-27) | CY25 Q1 (1.19 release) 
1.15    | CY23 Q3 (2023-09-27) | CY24 Q3 (1.18 release) 
1.14    | CY23 Q2 (2023-06-21) | CY24 Q2 (1.17 release) 
1.13    | CY23 Q1 (2023-03-01) | CY24 Q1 (2024-03-27) 
1.12    | CY22 Q4 (2022-10-12) | CY23 Q3 (2023-09-27) 

**Long-term support** extends support for specific Vault versions for an
additional year with:

- patches for bugs that may cause outages.
- patches for critical vulnerabilities and exposures.
- high-risk security patches.

After the first year, LTS Vault versions move from standard support to long-term
support for an additional year.

<a id="where" />

## Where do I enable long-term support?

You do not need to download a separate binary or set a flag for LTS support. As
long as you select an LTS Vault Enterprise version (e.g., 1.16, 1.19) when you
[install](/vault/install) or [upgrade](/vault/docs/upgrading) your Vault
instance, LTS is included.

<a id="when" />

## When are LTS versions released?

As of Vault Enterprise 1.16, the first release of a calendar year includes
long-term support.

LTS versions overlap by one year with the previous LTS version entering its
long-term support window when the new LTS version begins its standard support
window.

<a id="why" />

## Why is there a risk to updating to a non-LTS Vault version?

Long-term support is intended for Enterprise customers who cannot upgrade
every quarter to stay within the standard support timeline of one year. The
goal is to establish a predictable upgrade path with a longer timeline rather
than extending the lifetime for every Vault version.

Long-term support ensures your Vault version continues to receive critical
patches for an additional year. If you upgrade to a non-LTS version, you are
moving your Vault instance to a version that lacks extended support, which means
your Vault version stops receiving updates once it leaves the standard support
window:

Version | Expected release | Standard support ends  | Long-term support ends
------- | ---------------- | ---------------------- | ---------------------
1.19    | CY25 Q1          | CY26 Q1 (1.22 release) | CY27 Q1 (1.25 release)
1.18    | CY24 Q3          | CY25 Q3 (1.21 release) | Not provided
1.17    | CY24 Q2          | CY25 Q2 (1.20 release) | Not provided
1.16    | CY24 Q1          | CY25 Q1 (1.19 release) | CY26 Q1 (1.22 release) 

If a newer version of Vault includes features you want to take advantage of, you
have two options:

1. Wait for the next available LTS release to maintain long-term support.
1. Upgrade immediately, then upgrade to an LTS release before the standard
   support window expires.

<a id="how" />

## How do I upgrade my Vault installation?

You should follow whatever upgrade process you currently use to patch or update
your Vault installation. However, we recommend allowing additional time as
upgrading from version LTS to LTS+1 **may** require transitional upgrades to
move through the intermediate Vault versions.
