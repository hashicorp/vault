# Long-term support for Vault

@include 'alerts/enterprise-only.mdx'

Long-term support (LTS) eases upgrade requirements for installations that cannot
upgrade frequently, quickly, or easily.

## Who should consider long-term support?

Vault upgrades are challenging, especially for sensitive or critical workflows,
extensive integrations, and large-scale deployments. Strict upgrade policies
also require significant planning, testing, and employee hours to execute
successfully.

Customers who need assurances that their current installation will receive
critical bug fixes and security patches with minimal service disruptions should
consider moving to a Vault Enterprise version with long-term support.

<a id="what" />

## What is long-term support?

Long-term support offers extended maintenance through minor releases for select,
major Vault Enterprise versions.

The standard [support period and end of life policy](https://go.hashi.co/vault-support-policy)
covers "N&minus;2" versions, which means, at any given time, HashiCorp maintains
the current version ("N") and the two previous versions ("N&minus;2").

Vault versions typically update 3 times per calendar year (CY), which means that
**standard maintenance** for a given Vault version lasts approximately 1 year.
After the first year, LTS Vault versions move from standard maintenance to
**extended maintenance** for three additional major version releases (approximately one additional year)
with patches for bugs that may cause outages and critical vulnerabilities and exposures (CVEs).

Maintenance updates               | Standard maintenance | Extended maintenance
--------------------------------- | -------------------- | --------------------
Performance improvements          | YES                  | NO
Bug fixes                         | YES                  | OUTAGE-RISK ONLY
Security patches                  | YES                  | HIGH-RISK ONLY
CVE patches                       | YES                  | YES

<a id="where" />

## Where do I enable long-term support?

You do not need to download a separate binary or set a flag for long-term
support. As long as you select an LTS Vault Enterprise version
(e.g., 1.16, 1.19) when you [install](/vault/install) or [upgrade](/vault/docs/upgrading) your
Vault instance, LTS is included.

<a id="when" />

## When are LTS versions released?

As of Vault Enterprise 1.16, the first release of a calendar year includes
long-term support.

LTS versions overlap by one year with the previous LTS version entering its
extended maintenance window when the new LTS version begins its standard
maintenance window.

<a id="why" />

## Why is there a risk to updating to a non-LTS Vault Enterprise version?

Long-term support is intended for Enterprise customers who cannot upgrade
frequently enough to stay within the standard maintenance timeline of one year.
The goal is to establish a predictable upgrade path with a longer timeline
rather than extending the lifetime for every Vault version.

Long-term support ensures your Vault Enterprise version continues to receive
critical patches for an additional three major version releases (approximately one additional year).
If you upgrade to a non-LTS version,you are moving your Vault instance to a version
that lacks extended support. Non-LTS versions stop receiving updates once they leave
the standard maintenance window.

@include 'ld-images/lts/lts-upgrade-path.mdx'

Version | Expected release | Standard maintenance ends  | Extended maintenance ends
------- | ---------------- | -------------------------- | ---------------------
1.19    | CY25 Q1          | CY26 Q1 (1.22 release)     | CY27 Q1 (1.25 release)
1.18    | CY24 Q3          | CY25 Q3 (1.21 release)     | Not provided
1.17    | CY24 Q2          | CY25 Q2 (1.20 release)     | Not provided
1.16    | CY24 Q1          | CY25 Q1 (1.19 release)     | CY26 Q1 (1.22 release)

If a newer version of Vault Enterprise includes features you want to take
advantage of, you have two options:

1. Wait for the next available LTS release to maintain long-term support.
1. Upgrade immediately, then upgrade to an LTS release before the standard
   maintenance window expires.

<a id="how" />

## How do I upgrade my Vault Enterprise LTS installation?

You should follow your existing upgrade process for major version upgrades but
allow additional time. Upgrading from version LTS to LTS+1 translates to jumping
3 major Vault Enterprise versions, which **may** require transitional upgrades
to move through the intermediate Vault versions.
