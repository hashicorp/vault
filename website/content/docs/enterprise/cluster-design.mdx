# Design your Vault Enterprise cluster

@include 'alerts/enterprise-only.mdx'

If you want to implement a robust Vault cluster, you need to understand how
Vault manages clusters, storage, and replication.

## Before you start 

- **Complete the [HashiCorp Enterprise Academy Onboarding](https://onboarding.hashicorp.com/trainings) for Vault**.
- **Watch the [Raft consensus demo](https://thesecretlivesofdata.com/raft/) demo**.

## Step 1: Plan your cluster architecture

1. Review the [Integrated storage](/vault/docs/concepts/integrated-storage)
   overview to learn the basics about Vault integrated storage.
1. Review the [Vault multi-cluster architecture guide](/well-architected-framework/zero-trust-security/multi-cluster-architecture)
   to learn the best practices for running multiple Vault clusters.
1. Review the [Vault Enterprise replication overview](/vault/docs/enterprise/replication)
   to learn the differences between performance replication and disaster
   recovery replication.
1. Review the [Vault with integrated storage reference architecture](/well-architected-framework/zero-trust-security/raft-reference-architecture)
   guide to learn the best practices for using Vault integrated storage
   in a zero-trust security posture.

## Step 2: Review anti-patterns for Vault configuration

You can help keep your Vault environments healthy by avoiding established
anti-patterns.

The Hashicorp Well-architected framework documentation provides in-depth
[Vault anti-patterns](/well-architected-framework/operational-excellence/security-vault-anti-patterns) guidance based on
lessons learned by customers operating Vault in the field.

## Step 3: Plan for maintenance at scale

The easiest way to run Vault at scale is to manage Vault programmatically with
Terraform and Sentinel.

1. Review the [Terraform intro](/terraform/intro).
1. Review the [Programmatic best practices](/vault/docs/configuration/programmatic-best-practices)
   guide to learn about managing Vault through Terraform.
1. Review the [Vault namespaces recommendations](/vault/tutorials/enterprise/namespace-structure#use-namespaces-sparingly).
