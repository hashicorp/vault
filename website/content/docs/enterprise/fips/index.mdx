# FIPS compliance in Vault

@include 'alerts/enterprise-only.mdx'

The [Federal Information Processing Standard](https://www.nist.gov/federal-information-standards-fips)
is a cryptography-focused certification standard for U.S. Government usage.

Hashicorp's Vault Enterprise supports the modes of FIPS compliance documented below.

## FIPS 140-3 inside

Vault Enterprise now includes release flavors with FIPS 140-3 compliant
cryptography built into the Vault binary. More information on these releases
can be found on the [FIPS 140-3 Inside](/vault/docs/enterprise/fips/fips1403) page.

## Seal wrap

Before our FIPS Inside effort, Vault [depended on](https://www.hashicorp.com/vault-compliance)
an external HSM for FIPS 140-2/3 compliance. This uses the [Seal Wrap](/vault/docs/enterprise/fips/sealwrap)
functionality to wrap security relevant keys in an extra layer of encryption.

## Comparison of versions

The below table attempts to documents the FIPS compliance of various Vault
operations between FIPS Inside and FIPS Seal Wrap. This table is by no means
an official evaluation of either product; refer to the Leidos Letters of
Attestation for that information.
