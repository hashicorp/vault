# Built-in FIPS 140-3 support

@include 'alerts/enterprise-only.mdx'

Special builds of Vault Enterprise (marked with a `fips1403` feature name)
include built-in support for FIPS 140-3 compliance. Unlike using Seal Wrap
for FIPS compliance, this binary has no external dependencies on a HSM.

To use this feature, you must have an active or trial license for Vault
Enterprise Plus (HSMs). To start a trial, contact [HashiCorp
sales](mailto:sales@hashicorp.com).

## Using FIPS 140-3 Vault enterprise

FIPS 140-3 Inside versions of Vault Enterprise behave like non-FIPS versions
of Vault. No restrictions are placed on algorithms; it is up to the operator
to ensure Vault remains in a FIPS-compliant mode of operation. This means
configuring some Secrets Engines to permit a limited set of algorithms (e.g.,
forbidding ed25519-based CAs with PKI Secrets Engines).

Because Vault Enterprise may return secrets in plain text, it is important to
ensure the Vault server's `listener` configuration section utilizes TLS. This
ensures secrets are transmitted securely from Server to Client. Additionally,
note that TLSv1.3 will not work with FIPS 140-3 Inside, as HKDF is not a
certified primitive. If TLSv1.3 is desired, it is suggested to front Vault
Server with a FIPS-certified load balancer.

A non-exhaustive list of potential compliance issues include:

 - Using Ed25519 or ChaCha20+Poly1305 keys with the Transit Secrets Engine,
 - Using Ed25519 keys as CAs in the PKI or SSH Secrets Engines,
 - Using FF3-1/FPE in Transform Secrets Engine, or
 - Using a Derived Key (using HKDF) for Agent auto-authing or the Transit
   Secrets Engine.
 - Using **Entropy Augmentation**: because BoringCrypto uses its internal,
   FIPS 140-3 approved RNG, it cannot mix entropy from other sources.
   Attempting to use EA with FIPS 140-3 HSM enabled binaries will result
   in failures such as `panic: boringcrypto: invalid code execution`.

Hashicorp can only provide general guidance regarding using Vault Enterprise
in a FIPS-compliant manner. We are not a NIST-certified testing laboratory
and thus organizations may need to consult an approved auditor for final
information.

The FIPS 140-3 variant of Vault uses separate binaries; these are available
from the following sources:

 - From the [Hashicorp Releases Page](https://releases.hashicorp.com/vault),
   ending with the `+ent.fips1403` and `+ent.hsm.fips1403` suffixes.
 - From the [Docker Hub `hashicorp/vault-enterprise-fips`](https://hub.docker.com/r/hashicorp/vault-enterprise-fips)
   container repository.
 - From the [AWS ECR `hashicorp/vault-enterprise-fips`](https://gallery.ecr.aws/hashicorp/vault-enterprise-fips)
   container repository.
 - From the [Red Hat Access `hashicorp/vault-enterprise-fips`](https://catalog.redhat.com/software/containers/hashicorp/vault-enterprise-fips/628d50e37ff70c66a88517ea)
   container repository.

~> **Note**: When pulling the FIPS UBI-based images, note that they are
   ultimately designed for OpenShift certification; consider either adding
   the `--user root --cap-add IPC_LOCK` options, to allow Vault to enable
   mlock, or use the `--env SKIP_SETCAP=1` option, to disable mlock
   completely, as appropriate for your environment.

### Usage restrictions

#### Migration restrictions

Hashicorp **does not** support in-place migrations from non-FIPS Inside
versions of Vault to FIPS Inside versions of Vault, regardless of version.
A fresh cluster installation is required to receive support. We generally
recommend avoiding direct upgrades and replicated-migrations for several
reasons:

 - Old entries remain encrypted with the old barrier key until overwritten,
   this barrier key was likely not created by a FIPS library and thus
   is not compliant.
 - Many secrets engines internally create keys; things like Transit create
   and store keys, but don't store any data (inside of Vault) -- these would
   still need to be accessible and rotated to a new, FIPS-compliant key.
   Any PKI engines would have also created non-compliant keys, but rotation
   of say, a Root CA involves a concerted, non-Vault effort to accomplish
   and must be done thoughtfully.

As such Hashicorp cannot provide support for workloads that are affected
either technically or via non-compliance that results from converting
existing cluster workloads to the FIPS 140-3 Inside binary.

Instead, we suggest leaving the existing cluster in place, and carefully
consider migration of specific workloads to the FIPS-backed cluster.  

#### Entropy augmentation restrictions

Entropy Augmentation **does not** work with FIPS 140-3 Inside. The internal
BoringCrypto RNG is FIPS 140-3 certified and does not accept entropy from
other sources. On Vault 1.11.0 and later, attempting to use Entropy
Augmentation will result in a warning ("Entropy Augmentation is not supported...")
and Entropy Augmentation will be disabled.

#### TLS restrictions

Vault Enterprise's FIPS modifications include restrictions to supported TLS
cipher suites and key information. Only the following cipher suites are
allowed:

 - `TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256`,
 - `TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384`,
 - `TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256`,
 - `TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384`,
 - `TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256`, and
 - `TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384`.

Additionally, only the following key types are allowed in TLS chains of trust:

 - RSA 2048, 3072, 4096, 7680, and 8192-bit;
 - ECDSA P-256, P-384, and P-521.

#### Heterogeneous cluster deployments

Hashicorp does not support mixed deployment scenarios within the same Vault
cluster, e.g., mixing FIPS and non-FIPS Vault binary versions, or mixing FIPS
Inside with FIPS Seal Wrap clusters. Clusters nodes must be of a single
binary/deployment type across the entire cluster. Usage of Seal Wrap with
the FIPS Inside binary is permitted.

Running a heterogeneous cluster is not permitted by FIPS, as components of
the system are not compliant with FIPS.

## Technical details

Vault Enterprise's FIPS 140-3 Inside binaries rely on a special version of the
Go toolchain which include a FIPS-validated BoringCrypto version. To ensure
your version of Vault Enterprise includes FIPS support, after starting the
server, make sure you see a line with `Fips: Enabled`, such as:

```
                    Fips: FIPS 140-3 Enabled, BoringCrypto version 7
```

~> **Note**: FIPS 140-3 Inside binaries depend on cgo, which require that a
   GNU C Library (glibc) Linux distribution be used to run Vault. We've
   additionally opted to certify only on the AMD64 architecture at this time.
   This means these binaries will not work on Alpine Linux based containers.

### FIPS 140-3 inside and external plugins

Vault Enterprise's built-in plugins are compiled into the Vault binary using
the same Go toolchain version that compiled the core Vault; this results in
these plugins having FIPS 140-3 compliance status as well. This same guarantee
does not apply to external plugins.

### Validating FIPS 140-3 inside

To validate that the FIPS 140-3 Inside binary correctly includes BoringCrypto,
run `go tool nm` on the binary to get a symbol dump. On non-FIPS builds,
searching for `goboringcrypto` in the output will yield no results, but on
FIPS-enabled builds, you'll see many results with this:

```
$ go tool nm vault | grep -i goboringcrypto
  4014d0 T _cgo_6880f0fbb71e_Cfunc__goboringcrypto_AES_cbc_encrypt
  4014f0 T _cgo_6880f0fbb71e_Cfunc__goboringcrypto_AES_ctr128_encrypt
  401520 T _cgo_6880f0fbb71e_Cfunc__goboringcrypto_AES_decrypt
  401540 T _cgo_6880f0fbb71e_Cfunc__goboringcrypto_AES_encrypt
  401560 T _cgo_6880f0fbb71e_Cfunc__goboringcrypto_AES_set_decrypt_key
...additional lines elided...
```

All FIPS cryptographic modules must execute startup tests. BoringCrypto uses
the `_goboringcrypto_BORINGSSL_bcm_power_on_self_test` symbol for this. To
ensure the Vault Enterprise binary is correctly executing startup tests, use
[GDB](https://www.sourceware.org/gdb/) to stop execution on this function to
ensure it gets hit.

```
$ gdb --args vault server -dev
...GDB startup messages elided...
(gdb) break _goboringcrypto_BORINGSSL_bcm_power_on_self_test
...breakpoint location elided...
(gdb) run
...additional GDB output elided...

```

Exact output may vary.

<div {...{"className":"alert alert-warning g-type-body"}}>

**Note**: When executing Vault Enterprise within GDB, GDB must rewrite
parts of the binary to permit stopping on the specified breakpoint. This
results in the HMAC of the contained BoringCrypto library changing,
breaking the FIPS integrity check. If execution were to be continued
in the example above via the `continue` command, a message like the
following would be emitted:

```
Continuing.
FIPS integrity test failed.
Expected: 18d35ae031f649825a4269d68d2e62583d060a31d359690f97b9c8bf8120cdf75b405f74be7018094da7eb5261f2f86d0f481cc3b5a9c7c432268d94bf91aad9

Thread 1 "vault" received signal SIGABRT, Aborted.
```

This is expected. Rerunning Vault without GDB (or with no breakpoints
set -- e.g., `delete 1`) will still result in this function executing, but
with the FIPS integrity check succeeding.

### BoringCrypto certification

BoringCrypto Version 7 uses the following FIPS 140-3 Certificate and software
version:

 - NIST CMVP [Certificate #4735](https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/Cryptographic-Module-Validation-Program/Certificate/4735).
 - BoringCrypto software version 2022061300

-### Leidos compliance

Leidos evaluated Vault for compliance with the FIPS 140-2 version of BoringCrypto.  HashiCorp will be seeking an evaluation against FIPS 140-3 
in the near future.  In the meantime, Vault has not modified it's integration with BoringCrypto since the FIPS 140-2 evaluation except to 
enable TLS 1.3 as is now allowed by the standard, and BoringCrypto itself is largely unchanged and has been certified as FIPS 140-3 validated.  

-What is the difference between Seal Wrap FIPS 140 compliance and the new FIPS Inside compliance?
- Only the storage of sensitive entries (seal wrapped entries) is covered by FIPS-validated crypto when using Seal Wrapping.
- The TLS connection to Vault by clients is not covered by FIPS-validated crypto when using Seal Wrapping (it is when using FIPS 140-2 Inside, per items 1, 2, 7, and 13 in the updated letter).
- The generation of key material  wasn't using FIPS-validated crypto in the Seal Wrap version (for example, the PKI certificates: item 8 in the updated FIPS 140-2 Inside letter; or SSH module: item 10 in the updated FIPS 140-2 Inside letter).
- With Seal Wrapping, some entries were protected with FIPS-validated crypto, but all crypto in Vault wasn't FIPS certified. With FIPS 140-2 Inside, by default (if the algorithm is certified), Vault will be using the certified crypto implementation.
