# Manage certificates

@include '/why-use-vault/manage-certificates-small.mdx'

Generates dynamic X.509 certificates without the manual process of generating a
private key and CSR, submitting to a CA, and waiting the signing process to
complete. Built-in authentication and authorization mechanisms in Vault provide
verification functionality and support unique, ephemeral certificate with short
CRLs.
