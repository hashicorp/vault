# Manage 3rd-party secrets

@include '/why-use-vault/manage-3p-secrets-small.mdx'


## Manage DB credentials

Use available database plugins to manage static and dynamic database credentials
with Vault.

Plugins for static credentials map internal Vault roles 1-to-1 to usernames in a
database. With static roles, Vault stores and automatically rotates passwords
for the associated database user based on a configurable period of time or
rotation schedule.

Plugins for dynamic database credentials generate database credentials on-demand
for clients based on pre-configured roles in Vault. Vault also uses leases to
automatically revoke and rotate credentials over time. Every client accesses the
database with unique credentials so tracing and auditing data access is easier.

## Manage cloud credentials

Third-party secret engines dynamically generate service principals with the
applicable role and group assignments mapped to internal Vault roles. Vault
then associates each service principle with a lease and automatically rotates
or revokes the service principal when the lease expires.

## Manage encryption keys

To work with cloud providers, you often need to use encryption keys issued and
stored by the provider in their own key management system (KMS). You also need
to maintain root of trust both in and out of the cloud for the security
of your applications.

Vault provides centralized management for the distribution and lifecycle of
cloud provider keys while letting you leveraging the cryptographic capabilities
native to your KMS providers.
