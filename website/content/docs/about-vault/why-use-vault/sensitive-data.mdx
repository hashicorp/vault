## Encrypt data


at rest
in transit

Many organizations seek solutions to encrypt/decrypt application data within a cloud or multi-datacenter environment; deploying cryptography and maintaining a complex key management infrastructure can be expensive and challenging to develop. Vault provides [encryption as a service](/vault/docs/secrets/transit) with centralized key management to simplify encrypting data in transit and stored across clouds and datacenters. Vault can encrypt/decrypt data stored elsewhere, essentially allowing applications to encrypt their data while storing it in the primary data store. Vault's security team manages and maintains the responsibility of the data encryption within the Vault environment, allowing developers to focus solely on encrypting/decrypting data as needed.
