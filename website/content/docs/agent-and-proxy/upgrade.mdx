# Upgrade Agent or Proxy

The Vault Agent is an API client of the Vault Server. Vault APIs are almost
always backwards compatible. When they are not, this is called out in the
upgrade guide for the new Vault version, and there is a lengthy deprecation
period. The Vault Agent version can lag behind the Vault Server version, though
we recommend keeping all Vault instances up to date with the most recent minor Vault version
to the extent possible.
