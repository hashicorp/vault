# Use Kubernetes persistent cache

When `kubernetes` is configured for the persistent cache type, Vault Proxy will optimize the
persistent cache specifically for Kubernetes. This type of persistent cache requires a Kubernetes
service account token. The service account token is used during encryption and decryption of the
persistent cache as an additional integrity check.

The Vault Proxy persistent cache file in Kubernetes should only be used for handing off Vault tokens
and leases between initialization and sidecar Vault Proxy containers. This cache file should be shared
using a memory volume between the Vault Proxy containers.

## Configuration

- `service_account_token_file` `(string: optional)` - When type is set to `kubernetes`,
  this configures the path on disk where the Kubernetes service account token can be found.
  Defaults to `/var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount/token`.
