# Auto-auth method: Azure

The `azure` method reads in Azure instance credentials and uses them to
authenticate with the [Azure Auth
method](/vault/docs/auth/azure). It reads most
parameters needed for authentication directly from instance information based
on the value of the `resource` parameter.

## Configuration

- `role` `(string: required)` - The role to authenticate against on Vault

- `authenticate_from_environment` `(boolean: false)` - If set to true, will attempt to make an Azure
  identity object through Azure specific environment variables, in priority order and as specified [in
  Azure documentation][environment-variables]. Will work seamlessly with Azure
  [Workload Identity][workload-identity] and others.

~> Note: If `authenticate_from_environment` is set to true, `object_id`, and `client_id` will be ignored
in favour of that authentication approach.

- `scope` `(string: optional)` - The scope to use when obtaining a token. If not supplied, will default to
  the value used for `resource` appended with "`/.default`" appended as a suffix. For more information on
  scopes in Azure, see [this document][scopes].

- `resource` `(string: required)` - The resource name to use when getting identity information.

- `object_id` `(string: optional)` - The object ID of the user-assigned managed identity to use
  when acquiring an [access token][azure-access-token]. Only one of `object_id` or `client_id`
  may be provided.

- `client_id` `(string: optional)` - The client ID of the user-assigned managed identity to use
  when acquiring an [access token][azure-access-token]. Only one of `object_id` or `client_id`
  may be provided.


## Example configuration

Example client auto-auth configuration block for an [Azure Workload Identity][workload-identity]:

```hcl
auto_auth {
  method {
    type = "azure"
    config = {
      authenticate_from_environment = true
      role = "dev-role"
      resource = "https://management.azure.com/"
    }
  }
}
```
