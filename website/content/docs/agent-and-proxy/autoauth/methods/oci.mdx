# Auto-auth method: Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI)

The `oci` method performs authentication against the [OCI Auth
method](/vault/docs/auth/oci).

## Credentials

The method use to authenticate is set using the `type` parameter. Valid values are `apikey` to authenticate using
API Key credentials and `instance` for Instance Principal credentials.

If `apikey` is used, the Vault agent will use the first credential it can successfully obtain in the following order:

1. Environment variables:
  - `OCI_tenancy_ocid`
  - `OCI_user_ocid`
  - `OCI_fingerprint`
  - `OCI_private_key_path`
2. Configuration file in `$HOME/.oci/config`
3. Path to configuration file defined in the `OCI_CONFIG_FILE` environment variable
4. Configuration file in `$HOME/.obmcs/config`

Wherever possible, we recommend using instance principal for credentials. These are rotated automatically by OCI
and require no effort on your part to provision, making instance principal the most secure of the three methods. If
using instance principal _and_ a custom `credential_poll_interval`, be sure the frequency is set to a value that is less
than OCI's rotation frequency. This is currently documented as
[multiple times a day](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Identity/Tasks/callingservicesfrominstances.htm#faq),
but from experience, credentials are rotated every 10 to 15 minutes.

## Configuration

### General

- `type` `(string: required)` - The type of authentication to use. Valid values are `apikey` and `instance`.

- `role` `(string: required)` - The role to authenticate against on Vault.

- `credential_poll_interval` `(duration: "60s", optional)` - In seconds, how frequently the Vault auto-auth method should check for new credentials.
