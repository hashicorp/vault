The `cf` method performs authentication against the [CF Auth
method](/vault/docs/auth/cf).

## Credentials

The Vault agent will use the `CF_INSTANCE_CERT` and `CF_INSTANCE_KEY` env variables to
construct a valid login call for CF.

## Configuration

- `role` `(string: required)` - The role to authenticate against on Vault.
