# Auto-auth method: token file

<Note>

This authentication method is tailored for the development experience,
and to facilitate getting started with Vault Agent and Vault Proxy. Vault Agent and
Vault Proxy should never be configured to use this auto-auth method in a production environment.

</Note>

The `token_file` method reads in an existing, valid Vault token from a file, and uses that
token in lieu of authenticating itself. While it's a first class auto-auth method for all intents
and purposes, it naturally doesn't authenticate itself, as it requires a token from elsewhere. Like
other auto-auth methods, this method will attempt to renew the token, as appropriate.

This auto-auth method is especially useful when testing Vault Agent or Vault Proxy without needing to set up
any authentication methods in Vault. For long-running Agent or Proxy processes, we strongly recommend another
auto-auth method, such that Agent and Proxy are issuing their own own authentication requests to Vault.

## Configuration

- `token_file_path` `(string: required)` - The path to the file with the token inside. This token cannot be a wrapping token.

## Example configuration

An example configuration for Vault Agent, using the `token_file` method to enable [auto-auth](/vault/docs/agent-and-proxy/autoauth), follows:

```hcl
pid_file = "./pidfile"

vault {
  address = "https://127.0.0.1:8200"
}

auto_auth {
  method {
    type = "token_file"

    config = {
      token_file_path = "/home/username/.vault-token"
    }
  }
}


api_proxy {
  use_auto_auth_token = true
}

listener "tcp" {
  address = "127.0.0.1:8100"
  tls_disable = true
}

template {
  source      = "/etc/vault/server.key.ctmpl"
  destination = "/etc/vault/server.key"
}

template {
  source      = "/etc/vault/server.crt.ctmpl"
  destination = "/etc/vault/server.crt"
}
```
