# Vault agent kubernetes persistent cache

When `kubernetes` is configured for the persistent cache type, Vault Agent will optimize the
persistent cache specifically for Kubernetes. This type of persistent cache requires a Kubernetes
service account token. The service account token is used during encryption and decryption of the
persistent cache as an additional integrity check.

The Vault Agent persistent cache file in Kubernetes should only be used for handing off Vault tokens
and leases between initialization and sidecar Vault Agent containers. This cache file should be shared
using a memory volume between the Vault Agent containers.

If the Vault Agent Injector for Kubernetes is being used, the persistent cache is automatically configured
and used if the annotation [`vault.hashicorp.com/agent-cache-enable: true`](/vault/docs/platform/k8s/injector/annotations#vault-hashicorp-com-agent-cache-enable) is set.

## Configuration

- `service_account_token_file` `(string: optional)` - When type is set to `kubernetes`,
  this configures the path on disk where the Kubernetes service account token can be found.
  Defaults to `/var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount/token`.
