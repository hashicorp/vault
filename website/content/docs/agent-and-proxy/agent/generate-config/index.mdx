# agent generate-config

Generates a simple Vault Agent configuration file from the given parameters.

Currently, the only supported configuration type is `env-template`, which
helps you generate a configuration file with environment variable templates
for running Vault Agent in
[process supervisor](/vault/docs/agent-and-proxy/agent/process-supervisor)
mode.

For every specified secret `-path`, the command will attempt to generate one or
multiple `env_template` entries based on the `JSON` key(s) stored in the
specified secret. If the secret `-path` ends with `/*`, the command will
attempt to recurse through the secrets tree rooted at the given path,
generating `env_template` entries for each encountered secret. Currently,
only [kv-v1](/vault/docs/secrets/kv/kv-v1) and
[kv-v2](/vault/docs/secrets/kv/kv-v2) paths are supported.

The command specified in the `-exec` option will be used to generate an
`exec` entry, which will tell Vault Agent which child process to run.

In addition to the `env_template` entries, the command generates an `auto_auth`
section with `token_file` authentication method. While this method is very
convenient for local testing, it should **NOT** be used in production. In a
production environment, please use any other
[Auto-Auth method](/vault/docs/agent-and-proxy/autoauth/methods) instead.

By default, the file will be generated in the local directory as `agent.hcl`
unless a path is specified as an argument.

## Example

Before generating a configuration file, let's insert a secret `foo`:

```shell-session
$ vault kv put -mount=secret foo user="admin" password="s3cr3t"
```

Generate an agent configuration file which will reference `secret/foo`:

```shell-session
$ vault agent generate-config \
         -type="env-template" \
         -exec="./my-app arg1 arg2" \
         -namespace="my/ns/" \
         -path="secret/foo" \
         my-config.hcl
```

**Expected output:**

<CodeBlockConfig hideClipboard>

```plaintext
Successfully generated "my-config.hcl" configuration file!
Warning: the generated file uses 'token_file' authentication method, which is not suitable for production environments.
```

</CodeBlockConfig>

This will produce `my-config.hcl` file in the current directory with contents
similar to the following:

```hcl
auto_auth {

  method {
    type = "token_file"

    config {
      token_file_path = "/Users/avean/.vault-token"
    }
  }
}

template_config {
  static_secret_render_interval = "5m"
  exit_on_retry_failure         = true
  max_connections_per_host      = 10
}

vault {
  address = "http://localhost:8200"
}

env_template "FOO_PASSWORD" {
  contents             = "{{ with secret \"secret/data/foo\" }}{{ .Data.data.password }}{{ end }}"
  error_on_missing_key = true
}
env_template "FOO_USER" {
  contents             = "{{ with secret \"secret/data/foo\" }}{{ .Data.data.user }}{{ end }}"
  error_on_missing_key = true
}

exec {
  command                   = ["./my-app", "arg1", "arg2"]
  restart_on_secret_changes = "always"
  restart_stop_signal       = "SIGTERM"
}
```

## Usage

The following flags are available in addition to the [standard set of
flags](/vault/docs/commands) included in all commands.

- `type` `(string: <required>)` - The type of configuration file to generate;
  currently, only `env-template` is supported.

- `path` `(string: "")` - Path to a kv-v1 or kv-v2 secret
  (e.g. `secret/data/foo`, `kv-v2/my-app/*`); multiple secrets and tail `*`
  wildcards are allowed.

- `-exec` `(string: "env")` - The command to execute in agent process
  supervisor mode.
