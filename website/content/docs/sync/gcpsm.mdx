# Google Cloud Platform Secret Manager Sync Destination

The Google Cloud Platform Secret Manager sync destination allows Vault to safely synchronize secrets to your GCP projects.
This is a low footprint option that enables your applications to benefit from Vault-managed secrets without requiring them
to connect directly with Vault. This guide walks you through the configuration process.

Prerequisites:
* Ability to read or create KVv2 secrets
* Ability to create GCP Service Account credentials with access to the Secret Manager
* Ability to create sync destinations and associations on your Vault server

## Setup

1. If you do not already have a Service Account, navigate to the IAM & Admin page in the Google Cloud console to
[create a new Service Account](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/service-accounts-create) with the
[necessary permissions](/vault/docs/sync/gcpsm#permissions). [Instructions](/vault/docs/sync/gcpsm#provision-service-account)
to provision this Service Account via Terraform can be found below.

1. Configure a sync destination with the Service Account json credentials created in the previous step. See docs for
[alternative ways](/vault/docs/secrets/gcp#authentication) to pass in the `credentials` parameter.

  ```shell-session
  $ vault write sys/sync/destinations/gcp-sm/my-dest credentials=@path/to/credentials.json
  Key                   Value
  ---                   -----
  connection_details    map[credentials:*****]
  name                  my-dest
  type                  gcp-sm
  ```

## Usage

1. If you do not already have a KVv2 secret to sync, mount a new KVv2 secrets engine and create a secret.

  ```shell-session
  $ vault secrets enable -path=my-kv kv-v2
  Success! Enabled the kv-v2 secrets engine at: my-kv/

  $ vault kv put -mount=my-kv my-secret foo=bar
  ==== Secret Path ====
  my-kv/data/my-secret

  ======= Metadata =======
  Key                Value
  ---                -----
  created_time       <timestamp>
  custom_metadata    <nil>
  deletion_time      n/a
  destroyed          false
  version            1
  ```

1. Create an association between your GCP SM destination and the secret to synchronize

  ```shell-session
  vault write sys/sync/destinations/aws-sm/my-dest/associations/set mount=my-kv secret_name=my-secret
  Key                   Value
  ---                   -----
  associated_secrets    map[kv_1234/my-secret:map[accessor:kv_1234 secret_name:my-secret sync_status:SYNCED updated_at:<timestamp>]]
  store_name            my-dest
  store_type            gcp-sm
  ```

1. Navigate to the [Secret Manager](https://console.cloud.google.com/security/secret-manager) in the Google Cloud console
to confirm your secret was successfully created in your GCP project.

Moving forward, any modification on the Vault secret will be propagated in near real time to its GCP Secret Manager
counterpart. Creating a new secret version in Vault will create a new version in GCP Secret Manager. Deleting the secret
or the association in Vault will delete the secret in your GCP project as well.

## Permissions

The credentials given to Vault must have the following permissions to synchronize secrets:

```shell-session
secretmanager.secrets.create
secretmanager.secrets.delete
secretmanager.secrets.get
secretmanager.secrets.list
secretmanager.secrets.update
secretmanager.versions.access
secretmanager.versions.add
secretmanager.versions.destroy
secretmanager.versions.get
secretmanager.versions.list
```

## Provision Service Account

Vault needs to be configured with credentials to establish a trust relationship with your GCP project so it can managed
Secret Manager secrets on your behalf. The IAM & Admin page in the Google Cloud console can be used to
[create a new Service Account](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/service-accounts-create) with access to the Secret Manager.

You can equally use the [Terraform Google provider](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/google/latest/docs#authentication-and-configuration)
to provision a GCP Service Account with the appropriate policies.

  ```hcl
  provider "google" {
      // See https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/google/latest/docs#authentication-and-configuration to setup the Google Provider
      // for options on how to configure this provider. The following parameters or environment
      // variables are typically used.

      // Parameters
      // region = "" (Optional)
      // project = ""
      // credentials = ""

      // Environment Variables
      // GOOGLE_REGION (optional)
      // GOOGLE_PROJECT
      // GOOGLE_CREDENTIALS	(The path to a service account key file with the
      //				        "Service Account Admin", "Service Account Key
      //					    Admin", and "Security Admin" roles attached)
  }

  data "google_client_config" "config" {}

  resource "google_service_account" "vault_secrets_sync_account" {
    account_id  = "gcp-sm-vault-secrets-sync"
    description = "service account for Vault Secrets Sync feature"
  }

  // Production environments should use a more restricted role.
  // The built-in secret manager admin role is used as an example for simplicity.
  data "google_iam_policy" "vault_secrets_sync_iam_policy" {
    binding {
      role = "roles/secretmanager.admin"
      members = [
        google_service_account.vault_secrets_sync_account.email,
      ]
    }
  }

  resource "google_project_iam_member" "vault_secrets_sync_iam_member" {
    project = data.google_client_config.config.project
    role    = "roles/secretmanager.admin"
    member  = google_service_account.vault_secrets_sync_account.member
  }

  resource "google_service_account_key" "vault_secrets_sync_account_key" {
    service_account_id = google_service_account.vault_secrets_sync_account.name
    public_key_type    = "TYPE_X509_PEM_FILE"
  }

  resource "local_file" "vault_secrets_sync_credentials_file" {
    content  = base64decode(google_service_account_key.vault_secrets_sync_account_key.private_key)
    filename = "gcp-sm-sync-service-account-credentials.json"
  }

  output "vault_secrets_sync_credentials_file_path" {
    value = abspath("${path.module}/${local_file.sync_service_account_credentials_file.filename}")
  }
  ```
