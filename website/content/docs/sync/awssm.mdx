# AWS Secrets Manager

The AWS Secrets Manager destination enables Vault to sync and unsync secrets of your choosing into
an external AWS account. When configured, Vault will actively maintain the state of each externally-synced
secret in realtime. This includes sending new secrets, updating existing secret values, and removing
secrets when they either get dissocaited from the destination or deleted from Vault.  

## Setup

The use of this sync destination requires prerequesite setup before beginning to configure it. Either an IAM
User or an IAM role must be set with the necessary policies in order for Vault to manage secrets in the
external destination. It is this IAM User or IAM Role in AWS for which access credentials will be generated,
then provided to Vault during configuration.

The following is an example policy outlining the required permissions to use secrets syncing:
```
{
	"Version": "2012-10-17",
	"Statement": [
	{
		"Effect": "Allow",
		"Action": [
			"secretsmanager:Create*",
			"secretsmanager:Put*",
			"secretsmanager:Update*",
			"secretsmanager:Delete*",
			"secretsmanager:TagResource",
			"secretsmanager:UntagResource"
		],
		"Resource": "*"
	}
	]
}
```

## Usage

When AWS credentials have been obtained, Vault can be configured to create an AWS destination, then
begin to associate your secrets with this destination.

1. Store any KV secret into Vault, like so:
	```shell-session
	$ vault kv put secret/foo mypass=bar
	```
	Output:
	```
	=== Secret Path ===
	secret/data/foo

	======= Metadata =======
	Key                Value
	---                -----
	created_time       2023-09-19T13:17:23.395109Z
	custom_metadata    <nil>
	deletion_time      n/a
	destroyed          false
	version            1
	```

1.	Configure the sync destination:

	```shell-session
	$ vault write sys/sync/destinations/aws-sm/my-awssm-1 \
	access_key_id='AKIAJWVN5Z4FOFT7NLNA' \
	secret_access_key='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' \
	region='us-east-1'
	```
	Output:
	```text
	Key                   Value
	---                   -----
	connection_details    map[access_key_id:***** region:us-east-1 secret_access_key:*****]
	name                  my-awssm-1
	type                  aws-sm
	```

1.	Set a secret to be associated with the configured secret destination:
	```shell-session
	$ vault write sys/sync/destinations/aws-sm/my-awssm-1/associations/set \
	mount='secret' \
	secret_name='foo'
	```
	Output:
	```
	Key                   Value
	---                   -----
	associated_secrets    map[kv_37993f8a/foo:map[accessor:kv_37993f8a secret_name:foo sync_status:SYNCED updated_at:2023-09-19T13:17:35.085581-05:00]]
	store_name            aws1
	store_type            aws-sm
	```
