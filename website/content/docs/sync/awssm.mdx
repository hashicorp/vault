# AWS Secrets Manager

The AWS Secrets Manager destination enables Vault to sync and unsync secrets of your choosing into
an external AWS account. When configured, Vault will actively maintain the state of each externally-synced
secret in near-realtime. This includes sending new secrets, updating existing secret values, and removing
secrets when they either get dissociated from the destination or deleted from Vault. This enables the
ability to keep control of all your secrets localized while leveraging the benefits of the AWS Secrets Manager.

Prerequisites:
* Ability to read or create KVv2 secrets
* Ability to create AWS IAM user and access keys with access to the Secrets Manager
* Ability to create sync destinations and associations on your Vault server

## Setup

1. Navigate to the [AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) console](https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/iamv2/home#/home)
  to configure a IAM user with access to the Secrets Manager. The following is an example policy outlining the required
  permissions to use secrets syncing.

  ```
  {
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
          "Effect": "Allow",
          "Action": [
            "secretsmanager:Create*",
            "secretsmanager:Update*",
            "secretsmanager:Delete*",
            "secretsmanager:TagResource"
          ],
          "Resource": "arn:aws:secretsmanager:*:*:secret:vault*"
        }
    ]
  }
  ```

1.	Configure the sync destination.

	```shell-session
	$ vault write sys/sync/destinations/aws-sm/my-awssm-1 \
		  access_key_id='$ACCESS_KEY_ID' \
		  secret_access_key='$SECRET_ACCESS_KEY' \
		  region='us-east-1'
	```

	**Output:**

	<CodeBlockConfig hideClipboard>

	```text
	Key                   Value
	---                   -----
	connection_details    map[access_key_id:***** region:us-east-1 secret_access_key:*****]
	name                  my-awssm-1
	type                  aws-sm
	```

	</CodeBlockConfig>

## Usage

1.	If you do not already have a KVv2 secret to sync, mount a new KVv2 secrets engine.

	```shell-session
	$ vault secrets enable -path=my-kv kv-v2
	```

	**Output:**

	<CodeBlockConfig hideClipboard>

	```plaintext
	Success! Enabled the kv-v2 secrets engine at: my-kv/
	```

	</CodeBlockConfig>

1. Create secrets you wish to sync with a target AWS Secrets Manager.

	```shell-session
	$ vault kv put -mount=my-kv my-secret foo=bar
	```

	**Output:**

	<CodeBlockConfig hideClipboard>

	```plaintext
	==== Secret Path ====
	my-kv/data/my-secret

	======= Metadata =======
	Key                Value
	---                -----
	created_time       2023-09-19T13:17:23.395109Z
	custom_metadata    <nil>
	deletion_time      n/a
	destroyed          false
	version            1
	```

	</CodeBlockConfig>

1.	Set a secret to be associated with this AWS SM destination:

	```shell-session
	$ vault write sys/sync/destinations/aws-sm/my-awssm-1/associations/set \
		mount='my-kv' \
		secret_name='my-secret'
	```

	**Output:**

	<CodeBlockConfig hideClipboard>

	```
	Key                   Value
	---                   -----
	associated_secrets    map[kv_37993f8a/my-secret:map[accessor:kv_37993f8a secret_name:my-secret sync_status:SYNCED updated_at:2023-09-19T13:17:35.085581-05:00]]
	store_name            aws1
	store_type            aws-sm
	```

	</CodeBlockConfig>

1. Navigate to the [Secrets Manager](https://console.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/) in the AWS console
	to confirm your secret was successfully synced.

Moving forward, any modification on the Vault secret will be propagated to its AWS Secrets Manager
counterpart. Creating a new secret version in Vault will update the one in AWS to the new version. Deleting either
the secret or the association in Vault will delete the secret in your AWS account as well.
