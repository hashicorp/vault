# AWS Secrets Manager

The AWS Secrets Manager destination enables Vault to sync and unsync secrets of your choosing into
an external AWS account. When configured, Vault will actively maintain the state of each externally-synced
secret in near-realtime. This includes sending new secrets, updating existing secret values, and removing
secrets when they either get dissociated from the destination or deleted from Vault. This enables the
ability to keep control of all your secrets localized while leveraging the benefits of the AWS Secrets Manager.

Prerequisites:
* Ability to read or create KVv2 secrets
* Ability to create AWS IAM user and access keys with access to the Secrets Manager
* Ability to create sync destinations and associations on your Vault server

## Setup

1. Navigate to the [AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) console](https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/iamv2/home#/home)
  to configure a IAM user with access to the Secrets Manager. The following is an example policy outlining the required
  permissions to use secrets syncing.

  ```json
  {
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
          "Effect": "Allow",
          "Action": [
            "secretsmanager:Create*",
            "secretsmanager:Update*",
            "secretsmanager:Delete*",
            "secretsmanager:TagResource"
          ],
          "Resource": "arn:aws:secretsmanager:*:*:secret:vault*"
        }
    ]
  }
  ```

1.	Configure a sync destination with the IAM user credentials created in the previous step.

	```shell-session
	$ vault write sys/sync/destinations/aws-sm/my-awssm-1 \
		  access_key_id="$ACCESS_KEY_ID" \
		  secret_access_key="$SECRET_ACCESS_KEY" \
		  region='us-east-1'
	```

	**Output:**

	<CodeBlockConfig hideClipboard>

	```plaintext
	Key                   Value
	---                   -----
	connection_details    map[access_key_id:***** region:us-east-1 secret_access_key:*****]
	name                  my-awssm-1
	type                  aws-sm
	```

	</CodeBlockConfig>

## Usage

1.	If you do not already have a KVv2 secret to sync, mount a new KVv2 secrets engine.

	```shell-session
	$ vault secrets enable -path=my-kv kv-v2
	```

	**Output:**

	<CodeBlockConfig hideClipboard>

	```plaintext
	Success! Enabled the kv-v2 secrets engine at: my-kv/
	```

	</CodeBlockConfig>

1. Create secrets you wish to sync with a target AWS Secrets Manager.

	```shell-session
	$ vault kv put -mount=my-kv my-secret foo='bar'
	```

	**Output:**

	<CodeBlockConfig hideClipboard>

	```plaintext
	==== Secret Path ====
	my-kv/data/my-secret

	======= Metadata =======
	Key                Value
	---                -----
	created_time       2023-09-19T13:17:23.395109Z
	custom_metadata    <nil>
	deletion_time      n/a
	destroyed          false
	version            1
	```

	</CodeBlockConfig>

1.	Create an association between the destination and a secret to synchronize.

	```shell-session
	$ vault write sys/sync/destinations/aws-sm/my-awssm-1/associations/set \
		mount='my-kv' \
		secret_name='my-secret'
	```

	**Output:**

	<CodeBlockConfig hideClipboard>

	```plaintext
	Key                   Value
	---                   -----
	associated_secrets    map[kv_37993f8a/my-secret:map[accessor:kv_37993f8a secret_name:my-secret sync_status:SYNCED updated_at:2023-09-19T13:17:35.085581-05:00]]
	store_name            aws1
	store_type            aws-sm
	```

	</CodeBlockConfig>

1. Navigate to the [Secrets Manager](https://console.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/) in the AWS console
	to confirm your secret was successfully synced.

Moving forward, any modification on the Vault secret will be propagated to its AWS Secrets Manager
counterpart. Creating a new secret version in Vault will update the one in AWS to the new version. Deleting either
the secret or the association in Vault will delete the secret in your AWS account as well.

## Access management

You can allow or restrict access to secrets by attaching AWS Resource Tags
to secrets. For example, the following AWS IAM policy prevents Vault from
modifying secrets that were not created by a sync operation:

  <CodeBlockConfig hideClipboard>

    {
      "Version": "2012-10-17",
      "Statement": [
        {
          "Effect": "Allow",
          "Action": [
            "secretsmanager:*",
          ],
          "Resource": "*",
          "Condition": {
            "StringEquals": {
              "secretsmanager:ResourceTag/hashicorp:vault": "" # This tag is automatically added by Vault on every synced secrets
            }
          }
        }
      ]
    }

  </CodeBlockConfig>

To prevent out-of-band overwrites, we recommend adding a negative condition on
all write-access policies not used by Vault:

  <CodeBlockConfig hideClipboard>

    {
      "Version": "2012-10-17",
      "Statement": [
        {
          "Effect": "Deny",
          "Action": [
            "secretsmanager:*"
          ],
          "Resource": "*",
          "Condition": {
            "StringNotEquals": {
              "secretsmanager:ResourceTag/hashicorp:vault": "" # This tag is automatically added by Vault on every synced secrets
            }
          }
        }
      ]
    }

  </CodeBlockConfig>

<Warning title="Use wildcards with extreme caution">

  The previous examples use wildcards for the sake of brevity. We strongly
  recommend you use the principle of least privilege to restrict actions and
  resources for each use case to the minimum necessary requirements.
