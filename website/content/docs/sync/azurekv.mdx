# Azure Key Vault

The Azure Key Vault destination enables Vault to sync and unsync secrets of your choosing into
an external Azure account. When configured, Vault will actively maintain the state of each externally-synced
secret in realtime. This includes sending new secrets, updating existing secret values, and removing
secrets when they either get dissociated from the destination or deleted from Vault.

Prerequisites:
* Ability to read or create KVv2 secrets
* Ability to create Azure AD user credentials with access to an Azure Key Vault
* Ability to create sync destinations and associations on your Vault server

## Setup

1. If you do not already have an Azure Key Vault instance, navigate to the Azure Portal to create a new
  [Key Vault](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/key-vault/general/quick-create-portal).

1. A service principal with a client id and client secret will be needed to configure Azure Key Vault as a
  sync destination. This [guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/howto-create-service-principal-portal)
  will walk you through creating the service principal.

1. Once the service principal is created, the next step is to
  [grant the service principal](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/key-vault/general/rbac-guide?tabs=azure-cli)
  access to Azure Key Vault. To quickly get started, we recommend using the "Key Vault Secrets Officer" built-in role,
  which gives sufficient access to manage secrets. For more information, see the [Permissions](#permissions) section.


1. Configure a sync destination with the service principal credentials and Key Vault URI created in the previous steps.

  ```shell-session
  $ vault write sys/sync/destinations/azure-kv/my-azure-1 \
      key_vault_uri="$KEY_VAULT_URI" \
      client_id="$CLIENT_ID" \
      client_secret="$CLIENT_SECRET" \
      tenant_id="$TENANT_ID"
  ```

  **Output:**

  <CodeBlockConfig hideClipboard>

  ```plaintext
  Key                   Value
  ---                   -----
  connection_details    map[client_id:123 client_secret:***** key_vault_uri:***** tenant_id:123]
  name                  my-azure-1
  type                  azure-kv
  ```

  </CodeBlockConfig>

## Usage

1. If you do not already have a KVv2 secret to sync, mount a new KVv2 secrets engine.

  ```shell-session
  $ vault secrets enable -path='my-kv' kv-v2
  ```

  **Output:**

  <CodeBlockConfig hideClipboard>

  ```plaintext
  Success! Enabled the kv-v2 secrets engine at: my-kv/
  ```

  </CodeBlockConfig>

1. Create secrets you wish to sync with a target Azure Key Vault.

  ```shell-session
  $ vault kv put -mount='my-kv' my-secret foo='bar'
  ```

  **Output:**

  <CodeBlockConfig hideClipboard>

  ```plaintext
  ==== Secret Path ====
  my-kv/data/my-secret

  ======= Metadata =======
  Key                Value
  ---                -----
  created_time       2023-09-19T13:17:23.395109Z
  custom_metadata    <nil>
  deletion_time      n/a
  destroyed          false
  version            1
  ```

  </CodeBlockConfig>

1. Create an association between the destination and a secret to synchronize.

  ```shell-session
  $ vault write sys/sync/destinations/azure-kv/my-azure-1/associations/set \
      mount='my-kv' \
      secret_name='my-secret'
  ```

  **Output:**

  <CodeBlockConfig hideClipboard>

  ```plaintext
  Key                   Value
  ---                   -----
  associated_secrets    map[kv_7532a8b4/my-secret:map[accessor:kv_7532a8b4 secret_name:my-secret sync_status:SYNCED updated_at:2023-09-21T13:53:24.839885-07:00]]
  store_name            my-azure-1
  store_type            azure-kv
  ```

  </CodeBlockConfig>

1. Navigate to [Azure Key Vault](https://portal.azure.com/#view/HubsExtension/BrowseResource/resourceType/Microsoft.KeyVault%2Fvaults)
  in the Azure portal to confirm your secret was successfully created.

Moving forward, any modification on the Vault secret will be propagated in near real time to its Azure Key Vault
counterpart. Creating a new secret version in Vault will create a new version in Azure Key Vault. Deleting the secret
or the association in Vault will delete the secret in your Azure Key Vault as well.


## Permissions

For a more minimal set of permissions, you can create a
[custom role](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/custom-roles#steps-to-create-a-custom-role)
using the following JSON role definition. Be sure to replace the subscription id placeholder.

```json
{
  "properties": {
    "roleName": "Key Vault Secrets Reader Writer",
    "description": "Custom role for reading and updating Azure Key Vault secrets.",
    "permissions": [
      {
        "actions": [
          "Microsoft.KeyVault/vaults/secrets/read",
          "Microsoft.KeyVault/vaults/secrets/write"
        ],
        "notActions": [],
        "dataActions": [
          "Microsoft.KeyVault/vaults/secrets/delete",
          "Microsoft.KeyVault/vaults/secrets/backup/action",
          "Microsoft.KeyVault/vaults/secrets/purge/action",
          "Microsoft.KeyVault/vaults/secrets/recover/action",
          "Microsoft.KeyVault/vaults/secrets/restore/action",
          "Microsoft.KeyVault/vaults/secrets/readMetadata/action",
          "Microsoft.KeyVault/vaults/secrets/getSecret/action",
          "Microsoft.KeyVault/vaults/secrets/setSecret/action"
        ],
        "notDataActions": []
      }
    ],
    "assignableScopes": [
      "/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/"
    ]
  }
}
```

## Access management

You can allow or restrict access to secrets by using a separate Azure Key Vault instance for Vault sync destinations.
This corresponds with Microsoft's currently-recommended 
[best practices](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/key-vault/general/best-practices)
for managing secrets in Key Vault. Maintaining a boundary between Vault-managed secrets and other secrets through
separate Key Vaults provides increased security and access control.

Azure roles can be created to grant the necessary permissions for the service principal to access the Key Vault
with [role-based access control](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/overview).
A role assignment can be set for the Vault user principal to provide it the role's permissions within the Key Vault
instance, its resource group, or subscription. Additionally,
[Azure policies](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/key-vault/general/azure-policy) may further refine access control
limitations, such as denying the Vault user principal access to non-Vault related Key Vaults. The inverse, denying other
users any write-access to the Vault-related Key Vault, may be another choice.
