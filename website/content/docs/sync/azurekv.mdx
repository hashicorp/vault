# Azure Key Vault

The Azure Key Vault destination enables Vault to sync and unsync secrets of your choosing into
an external Azure account. When configured, Vault will actively maintain the state of each externally-synced
secret in realtime. This includes sending new secrets, updating existing secret values, and removing
secrets when they either get dissociated from the destination or deleted from Vault.

## Setup

A service principal with a client id and client secret will be needed to configure Azure Key Vault as a
sync destination. This [guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/howto-create-service-principal-portal)
will walk you through creating the service principal.

Once the service principal is created, the next step is to
[grant the service principal](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/key-vault/general/rbac-guide?tabs=azure-cli)
access to Azure Key Vault. To quickly get started, we recommend using the "Key Vault Secrets Officer" built-in role,
which gives sufficient access to manage secrets. For more information, see the [Permissions](#permissions) section.

When Azure credentials for the service principal have been obtained and it has access to Azure Key Vault,
Vault can be configured to create an Azure destination, then begin to associate your secrets with this destination.

1.	Configure the sync destination.

  ```shell-session
  $ vault write sys/sync/stores/azure-kv/my-azure-1 \
      key_vault_uri=$KEY_VAULT_URI \
      client_id=$CLIENT_ID \
      client_secret=$CLIENT_SECRET \
      tenant_id=$TENANT_ID
  ```

  **Output:**

  <CodeBlockConfig hideClipboard>

  ```text
  Key                   Value
  ---                   -----
  connection_details    map[client_id:123 client_secret:***** key_vault_uri:***** tenant_id:123]
  name                  my-azure-1
  type                  azure-kv
  ```

  </CodeBlockConfig>

## Usage

1. Store your KV secret into Vault.

  ```shell-session
  $ vault kv put secret/foo mypass=bar
  ```

  **Output:**

  <CodeBlockConfig hideClipboard>

  ```
  === Secret Path ===
  secret/data/foo

  ======= Metadata =======
  Key                Value
  ---                -----
  created_time       2023-09-21T20:52:47.723315Z
  custom_metadata    <nil>
  deletion_time      n/a
  destroyed          false
  version            1
  ```

  </CodeBlockConfig>

1. Set a secret to be associated with the configured secret destination.

  ```shell-session
  $ vault write sys/sync/destinations/azure-kv/my-azure-1/associations/set \
      mount='secret' \
      secret_name='foo'
  ```

  **Output:**

  <CodeBlockConfig hideClipboard>

  ```
  Key                   Value
  ---                   -----
  associated_secrets    map[kv_7532a8b4/foo:map[accessor:kv_7532a8b4 secret_name:foo sync_status:SYNCED updated_at:2023-09-21T13:53:24.839885-07:00]]
  store_name            my-azure-1
  store_type            azure-kv
  ```

  </CodeBlockConfig>

1. Navigate to [Azure Key Vault](https://portal.azure.com/#view/HubsExtension/BrowseResource/resourceType/Microsoft.KeyVault%2Fvaults) in the Azure portal
to confirm your secret was successfully created.

Moving forward, any modification on the Vault secret will be propagated in near real time to its Azure Key Vault
counterpart. Creating a new secret version in Vault will create a new version in Azure Key Vault. Deleting the secret
or the association in Vault will delete the secret in your Azure Key Vault as well.


## Permissions

For a more minimal set of permissions, you can create a
[custom role](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/custom-roles#steps-to-create-a-custom-role)
using the following JSON role definition. Be sure to replace the subscription id placeholder.

```json
{
  "properties": {
    "roleName": "Key Vault Secrets Reader Writer",
    "description": "Custom role for reading and updating Azure Key Vault secrets.",
    "permissions": [
      {
        "actions": [
          "Microsoft.KeyVault/vaults/secrets/read",
          "Microsoft.KeyVault/vaults/secrets/write"
        ],
        "notActions": [],
        "dataActions": [
          "Microsoft.KeyVault/vaults/secrets/delete",
          "Microsoft.KeyVault/vaults/secrets/backup/action",
          "Microsoft.KeyVault/vaults/secrets/purge/action",
          "Microsoft.KeyVault/vaults/secrets/recover/action",
          "Microsoft.KeyVault/vaults/secrets/restore/action",
          "Microsoft.KeyVault/vaults/secrets/readMetadata/action",
          "Microsoft.KeyVault/vaults/secrets/getSecret/action",
          "Microsoft.KeyVault/vaults/secrets/setSecret/action"
        ],
        "notDataActions": []
      }
    ],
    "assignableScopes": [
      "/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/"
    ]
  }
}
```
