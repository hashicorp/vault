# GitHub repository secrets

The GitHub repository sync destination allows Vault to safely synchronize secrets as GitHub repository action secrets.
This is a low footprint option that enables your applications to benefit from Vault-managed secrets without requiring them
to connect directly with Vault. This guide walks you through the configuration process.

Prerequisites:
* Ability to read or create KVv2 secrets
* Ability to create GitHub fine-grained or personal tokens with access to modify repository secrets
* Ability to create sync destinations and associations on your Vault server

## Setup

1. To get started with syncing Vault secrets to your GitHub repository, you will need an
  [access token](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens)
  which has access to the repository you want to manage secrets for and write permissions on the repository's actions secrets.
  In the list of GitHub permissions, this is simply called "Secrets". Choosing this will automatically include read-only Metadata.

1. Configure a sync destination with the access token created in the previous step.

  ```shell-session
  $ vault write sys/sync/destinations/gh/my-dest \
      access_token="$ACCESS_TOKEN" \
      repository_owner="$OWNER" \
      repository_name="$NAME"
  ```

  **Output:**

  <CodeBlockConfig hideClipboard>

  ```plaintext
  Key                   Value
  ---                   -----
  connection_details    map[access_token:***** repository_owner:<owner> repository_name:<name>]
  name                  my-dest
  type                  gh
  ```

  </CodeBlockConfig>

## Usage

1. If you do not already have a KVv2 secret to sync, mount a new KVv2 secrets engine.

  ```shell-session
  $ vault secrets enable -path=my-kv kv-v2
  ```

  **Output:**

  <CodeBlockConfig hideClipboard>

  ```
  Success! Enabled the kv-v2 secrets engine at: my-kv/
  ```

  </CodeBlockConfig>

1. Create secrets you wish to sync with a target GitHub repository for Actions.

  ```shell-session
  $ vault kv put -mount='my-kv' my-secret foo='bar'
  ```

  **Output:**

  <CodeBlockConfig hideClipboard>

  ```plaintext
  ==== Secret Path ====
  my-kv/data/my-secret

  ======= Metadata =======
  Key                Value
  ---                -----
  created_time       <timestamp>
  custom_metadata    <nil>
  deletion_time      n/a
  destroyed          false
  version            1
  ```

  </CodeBlockConfig>

1. Create an association between the destination and a secret to synchronize.

  ```shell-session
  $ vault write sys/sync/destinations/gh/my-dest/associations/set \
      mount=my-kv \
      secret_name=my-secret
  ```

  **Output:**

  <CodeBlockConfig hideClipboard>

  ```plaintext
  Key                   Value
  ---                   -----
  associated_secrets    map[kv_1234/my-secret:map[accessor:kv_1234 secret_name:my-secret sync_status:SYNCED updated_at:<timestamp>>]]
  store_name            my-dest
  store_type            gh
  ```

  </CodeBlockConfig>

1. Navigate to your GitHub repository settings to confirm your secret was successfully created.

Moving forward, any modification on the Vault secret will be propagated in near real time to its GitHub repository secrets
counterpart. Creating a new secret version in Vault will create a new version in GitHub. Deleting the secret
or the association in Vault will delete the secret in GitHub as well.

## Security

<Note>

GitHub only supports single value secrets, so KVv2 secrets from Vault will be stored as a JSON string.
In the example above, the value for secret "my-secret" will be synced to GitHub as the JSON string `{"foo":"bar"}` if the
destination is configured to use the `secret-path` [granularity level](/vault/docs/sync#granularity).

</Note>

If using the secret-path granularity, it is strongly advised to mask individual values for each sub-key to prevent the
unintended disclosure of secrets in any GitHub Action outputs. The following snippet illustrates how to mask each secret values:

  ```yaml
  name: Mask synced secret values

  on:
    workflow_dispatch

  jobs:
    synced-secret-examples:
      runs-on: ubuntu-latest
      steps:
        - name: âœ“ Mask synced secret values
          run: |
            for v in $(echo '${{ secrets.VAULT_KV_1234_MY_SECRET }}' | jq -r '.[]'); do
              echo "::add-mask::$v"
            done
  ```

If the GitHub destination uses the default `secret-key` granularity, the values are masked by GitHub automatically.
