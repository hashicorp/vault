# Secrets Sync

In certain circumstances, fetching secrets directly from Vault is impossible or impractical. To help with this challenge,
Vault can maintain a one-way sync for KVv2 secrets into various destinations that are easier to access for some clients.
With this, Vault remains the system of records but can cache a subset of secrets on various external systems acting as
trusted last-mile delivery systems.

A secret that is associated from a Vault KVv2 Secrets Engine into an external destination is actively managed by a continuous
process. If the secret value is updated in Vault, the secret is updated in the destination as well. If the secret is deleted
from Vault, it is deleted on the external system as well. This process is asynchronous and event-based. Vault propagates
modifications into the proper destinations automatically in a handful of seconds.

## Destinations

Secrets can be synced into various external systems, called destinations. The supported destinations are:
* [AWS Secrets Manager](/vault/docs/sync/awssm)
* [Azure Key Vault](/vault/docs/sync/azurekv)
* [GCP Secret Manager](/vault/docs/sync/gcpsm)
* [GitHub Repository Actions](/vault/docs/sync/github)
* [Vercel Projects](/vault/docs/sync/vercelproject)

## Associations

Syncing a secret into a given destination is done by creating an association via Vault's API between the targeted KVv2
secret and any of the configured destinations. Each secret's association keeps track of its current sync status,
the timestamp of its last status change, and the error code of the last sync or unsync operation, if it failed.

## Sync Statuses

There are several sync statuses which relay information about the outcome of the latest sync
operation to have occurred on that secret. The status information is stored inside each
association object returned by the endpoint and, upon failure, includes an error code describing the cause of the failure.

* `SYNCING` - The sync operation for the secret is currently in-progress.
* `SYNCED` - The sync operation was successful and sent the secret to the external destination.
* `UNSYNCING` - The unsync operation for the secret is currently in-progress.
* `UNSYNCED` - The unsync operation was successful and removed the secret from the external destination.
	This is returned when a secret itself is deleted but the association is not.
* `INTERNAL_VAULT_ERROR` - The sync or unsync operation failed due to an issue internal to Vault.
* `CLIENT_SIDE_ERROR` - The sync or unsync operation failed due to a configuration error.
	For example, the credentials used to configure the destination expired or were revoked.
* `EXTERNAL_SERVICE_ERROR` - The sync or unsync operation failed due to an issue with the
	external service provider's side.
* `UNKNOWN` - Vault is unable to determine the current state of the secret in regards to the external service.

## API
