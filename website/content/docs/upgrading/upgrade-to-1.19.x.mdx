# Overview

The Vault 1.19.x upgrade guide contains information on deprecations, important
or breaking changes, and remediation recommendations for anyone upgrading from
Vault 1.18. **Please read carefully**.

## Important changes

### Transit support for Ed25519ph and Ed25519ctx signatures

**NOTE**: This only applies to Transit Ed25519 keys.

On prior versions of Vault, when the sign and verify API endpoints backed by an Ed25519
key received the prehashed=true or the hash_algorithm=sha2-512 parameters they were ignored,
returning back or verifying a Pure Ed25519 signature. As of 1.19.x, setting these values
on Enterprise editions of Vault will now return an Ed25519ph signature and assume the
input has been hashed using the SHA-512 algorithm.

If neither prehashed nor hash_algorithm values are provided, the existing default of using
Pure Ed25519 signatures remains unchanged for both Enterprise and CE Vault editions. The change
is if those values had been overridden they were previously ignored but now will be enforced
based on the table below.

| Vault Edition | prehashed | hash_algorithm                | 1.19.x Signature                           | Previous Vault Versions Signature |

| CE            | not set   | not set                       | Pure Ed25519                               | Pure Ed25519                      |

| CE            | false     | sha2-512                      | An error is returned                       | Pure Ed25519                      |
| CE            | true      | any value other than sha2-512 | An error is returned                       | Pure Ed25519                      |
| CE            | true      | sha2-512                      | An error is returned (not supported on CE) | Pure Ed25519                      |

### LDAP user DN search with `upndomain`

The github.com/hashicorp/cap/ldap dependency has been upgraded to include a security improvement
which may be a breaking change for users. The enhancement ensures that user DN searches with
`upndomain` configured will now check that exactly one user is returned and error otherwise.
For more details, see https://github.com/hashicorp/cap/pull/151.

In previous versions of Vault, multiple users could be returned when searching for the user DN
with `upndomain` configured, and the last user would be selected. As of 1.19.x, such searches will
error if multiple users are returned.
