# Overview

The Vault 1.18.x upgrade guide contains information on deprecations, important
or breaking changes, and remediation recommendations for anyone upgrading from
Vault 1.17. **Please read carefully**.

## Important changes

<a id="activity-log" />

### Activity Log Changes

#### Default Activity Log Querying Period

The field `default_report_months` can no longer be configured or read. Any previously set values
will be ignored by the system.


Attempts to modify `default_report_months` through the
[/sys/internal/counters/config](/vault/api-docs/system/internal-counters#update-the-client-count-configuration)
endpoint, will result in the following warning from Vault:

<CodeBlockConfig hideClipboard>

```shell-session

WARNING! The following warnings were returned from Vault:

  * default_report_months is deprecated: defaulting to billing start time


```

</CodeBlockConfig>


The `current_billing_period` toggle for `/sys/internal/counters/activity` is also deprecated, as this will be set
true by default.

Attempts to set `current_billing_period` will result in the following warning from Vault:

<CodeBlockConfig hideClipboard>

```shell-session

WARNING! The following warnings were returned from Vault:

  * current_billing_period is deprecated; unless otherwise specified, all requests will default to the current billing period


```

</CodeBlockConfig>

### Docker image no longer contains `curl`

The `curl` binary is no longer included in the published Docker container images for Vault and Vault
Enterprise. If your workflow depends on `curl` being available in the container, consider one of the
following strategies:

#### Create a wrapper container image

Use the HashiCorp image as a base image to create a new container image with `curl` installed.

```Dockerfile
FROM hashicorp/vault-enterprise
RUN apk add curl
```

**NOTE:** While this is the preferred option it will require managing your own registry and rebuilding new images.

#### Install it at runtime dynamically

When running the image as root (not recommended), you can install it at runtime dynamically by using the `apk` package manager:

```shell-session
docker exec <CONTAINER-ID> apk add curl
```
```shell-session
kubectl exec -ti <NAME> -- apk add curl
```

When running the image as non-root without privilege escalation (recommended) you can use existing
tools to install a static binary of `curl` into the `vault` users home directory:

```shell-session
docker exec <CONTAINER-ID> wget https://github.com/moparisthebest/static-curl/releases/latest/download/curl-amd64 -O /home/vault/curl && chmod +x /home/vault/curl
```
```shell-session
kubectl exec -ti <NAME> -- wget https://github.com/moparisthebest/static-curl/releases/latest/download/curl-amd64 -O /home/vault/curl && chmod +x /home/vault/curl
```

**NOTE:** When using this option you'll want to verify that the static binary comes from a trusted source.
