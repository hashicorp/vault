# Resolve deduplication impact on external references

Fix external reference behavior for entities and groups renamed during identity
deduplication.



## How renaming affect external references

It it is possible that renaming resources could break external references if
they refer directly to the entity or group by name.

For example, if you have a Terraform configuration like this:

```hcl
terraform {
  required_providers {
    vault = {
      source = "hashicorp/vault"
    }
  }
}

provider "vault" {}

resource "vault_identity_entity" "BOB" {
  name              = "BOB"
  policies          = ["TEST"]
}


resource "vault_identity_entity" "bob" {
    name              = "bob"
    policies          = ["test"]
}
```

By default this Terraform config would not work correctly since Vault would
match the names in a case-insensitive way and reject creating the second
resource. But if you have had duplicates reported in your Vault cluster, that
means that due to some historical issue Vault is running in a mode that would
allow both of these case variations to exist a separate entities.

After activating the `force-identity-deduplication` flag, one of these entities
will no longer have the specified name and so Terraform will attempt to rename
it and be unable to because that violates the case-insensitive name constraint
that has be re-introduced. An apply would result in an error such as:

```
➜  tf_dupe_testing terraform apply
vault_identity_entity.bob: Refreshing state... [id=e8c5e633-fe37-5a49-4a29-32e2643d03bd]
vault_identity_entity.BOB: Refreshing state... [id=2577bc3f-67ab-dab7-93dc-e86f78194ff0]

Terraform used the selected providers to generate the following execution plan. Resource
actions are indicated with the following symbols:
  ~ update in-place

Terraform will perform the following actions:

  # vault_identity_entity.bob will be updated in-place
  ~ resource "vault_identity_entity" "bob" {
      + external_policies = false
        id                = "e8c5e633-fe37-5a49-4a29-32e2643d03bd"
      ~ name              = "bob-e8c5e633-fe37-5a49-4a29-32e2643d03bd" -> "bob"
        # (3 unchanged attributes hidden)
    }

Plan: 0 to add, 1 to change, 0 to destroy.

Do you want to perform these actions?
  Terraform will perform the actions described above.
  Only 'yes' will be accepted to approve.

  Enter a value: yes

vault_identity_entity.bob: Modifying... [id=e8c5e633-fe37-5a49-4a29-32e2643d03bd]

## Find affected references

TBD


## Solution


To resolve this, you will need to update any Terraform configuration with the
new name which you can get from the previous duplicate report:

```
WARN: [...] force_deduplication="would rename to bob-5789a392-e4fa-4df3-b2a9-ec11839f7ed1"
```

Or from future unseal logs:

```
WARN: duplicate entity `bob` was renamed to `bob-5789a392-e4fa-4df3-b2a9-ec11839f7ed1`
```

The same idea would apply to any other external systems that reference an entity
or group by name. Simply changing the reference to use the new name is the
simplest resolution.
