# Overview

This page contains the list of deprecations and important or breaking changes
for Vault 1.8.0 compared to 1.7. Please read it carefully.

## License Enhancements

Licenses and EULA enhancements have been introduced in the Vault 1.8 release.
These changes are important for Enterprise customers to review. They do not affect
OSS users. Please see the [License](/docs/enterprise/license) documentation for more details.

## Deprecations

The following API endpoints have been deprecated and will be removed in a future release:

* `sys/license` to manage licenses in storage; it is recommended to use
   [License Autoloading](/docs/enterprise/license/autoloading) instead.

* `/gcp/token/:roleset` and `/gcp/key/:roleset` paths for generating secrets for rolesets
  in GCP Secrets. Use `/gcp/roleset/:roleset/token` and `/gcp/roleset/:roleset/key` instead.

## Go Version

Vault 1.8.0 is built with Go 1.16. Please review the [Go Release
Notes](https://golang.org/doc/go1.16) for full details. Of particular note:

- Go 1.16 has added support for darwin/arm64. Vault binaries for this platform are
  now available supporting the Apple M1 CPU.
