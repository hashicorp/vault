# Overview

This page explains a known issue upgrading to Vault 1.1.2 for Enterprise users.
Please read it carefully.

## Known Issues

-> **NOTE:** This is a known issue applicable to _Vault Enterprise_.

During upgrades to 1.1.0, 1.1.1 or 1.1.2, Vault replication secondaries may
require an automatically-triggered reindex, either if upgrading from a pre-0.8
version of Vault or if a previously-issued reindex operation has failed in the
past. In these reindex scenarios, the secondary cluster will perform a complete
WAL replay, which can take a long time and is a partially blocking operation.

This is fixed in [Vault
1.1.3](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#113-june-5th-2019),
and we recommend upgrading to Vault 1.1.3+ rather than any prior 1.1.x version.
We also strongly recommend upgrading your Vault cluster to 1.1.3 if you are
running Vault Enterprise 1.1.0, 1.1.1 or 1.1.2.
