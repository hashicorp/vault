# Overview

This page contains the list of deprecations and important or breaking changes
for Vault 1.11.x compared to 1.10. Please read it carefully.

## Elasticsearch database secrets engine

The Elaticsearch Database Secrets Engine now uses the new `/_security` base API
path instead of `/_xpack/security` when managing Elasticsearch. If users are on
an Elasticsearch version prior to 6, they will need to switch back to the old
API path by setting the [bool config option](/vault/api-docs/secret/databases/elasticdb#use_old_xpack)
`use_old_xpack=true`.

## Activity Log Changes

### Disable client counting activity

License utilization cannot be reported if client counting is disabled. As of Vault Enterprise 1.11.12 and later, client counting cannot be disabled using `/sys/internal/counters/config` endpoint when automated license utilization reporting is enabled.

## Changes

@include 'pgx-params.mdx'

## Known issues

@include 'raft-retry-join-failure.mdx'

@include 'tokenization-rotation-persistence.mdx'

### LDAP pagination issue

There was a regression introduced in 1.11.10 relating to LDAP maximum page sizes, resulting in
an error `no LDAP groups found in groupDN [...] only policies from locally-defined groups available`.  The issue
occurs when upgrading Vault with an instance that has an existing LDAP Auth configuration.

As a workaround, disable paged searching using the following:
```shell-session
vault write auth/ldap/config max_page_size=-1
```

#### Impacted versions

Affects Vault 1.11.10.

@include 'pki-double-migration-bug.mdx'
