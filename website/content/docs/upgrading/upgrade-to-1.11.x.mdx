# Overview

This page contains the list of deprecations and important or breaking changes
for Vault 1.11.x compared to 1.10. Please read it carefully.

## Elasticsearch Database Secrets Engine

The Elaticsearch Database Secrets Engine now uses the new `/_security` base API
path instead of `/_xpack/security` when managing Elasticsearch. If users are on
an Elasticsearch version prior to 6, they will need to switch back to the old
API path by setting the [bool config option](/api-docs/secret/databases/elasticdb#use_old_xpack)
`use_old_xpack=true`.
