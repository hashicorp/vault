# Overview

The Vault 1.15.x upgrade guide contains information on deprecations, important
or breaking changes, and remediation recommendations for anyone upgrading from
Vault 1.14. **Please read carefully**.

## Consul service registration

As of version 1.15, `service_tags` supplied to Vault for the purpose of [Consul
service registration](/vault/docs/configuration/service-registration/consul#service_tags)
will be **case-sensitive**.

In previous versions of Vault tags were converted to lowercase which led to issues,
for example when tags contained Traefik rules which use case-sensitive method names
such as `Host()`.

If you previously used Consul service registration tags ignoring case, or relied
on the lowercase tags created by Vault, then this change may cause unexpected behavior.

Please audit your Consul storage stanza to ensure that you either:

* Manually convert your `service_tags` to lowercase if required
* Ensure that any system that relies on the tags is aware of the new case-preserving behavior

## Rollback metrics

Vault no longer measures and reports the metrics `vault.rollback.attempts.{MOUNTPOINT}` and `vault.route.rollback.{MOUNTPOINT}` by default. The new default metrics are `vault.rollback.attempts`
and `vault.route.rollback`, which **do not** contain the mount point in the metric name.

To continue measuring `vault.rollback.attempts.{MOUNTPOINT}` and
`vault.route.rollback.{MOUNTPOINT}`, you must explicitly enable mount-specific
metrics in the `telemetry` stanza of your Vault configuration with the
[`add_mount_point_rollback_metrics`](/vault/docs/configuration/telemetry#add_mount_point_rollback_metrics)
option.
