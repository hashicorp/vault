# Overview

The Vault 1.17.x upgrade guide contains information on deprecations, important
or breaking changes, and remediation recommendations for anyone upgrading from
Vault 1.16. **Please read carefully**.

## Important changes

### PKI sign-intermediate now truncates notAfter field to signing issuer

Prior to 1.17.x, Vault allowed the calculated sign-intermediate `notAfter` field
to go beyond the signing issuer `notAfter` field. The extended value lead to a
CA chain that would not validate properly. As of 1.17.x, Vault truncates the
intermediary `notAfter` value to the signing issuer `notAfter` if the calculated
field is greater.

#### How to opt out

You can use the new `enforce_leaf_not_after_behavior` flag on the
sign-intermediate API along with the `leaf_not_after_behavior` flag for the
signing issuer to opt out of the truncating behavior.

When you set `enforce_leaf_not_after_behavior` to true, the sign-intermediate
API uses the `leaf_not_after_behavior` value configured for the signing issuer
to control truncation the behavior. Setting the issuer `leaf_not_after_behavior`
field to `permit` and `enforce_leaf_not_after_behavior` to true restores the
legacy behavior.
