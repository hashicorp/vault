# Overview

The Vault 1.17.x upgrade guide contains information on deprecations, important
or breaking changes, and remediation recommendations for anyone upgrading from
Vault 1.16. **Please read carefully**.

## Important changes

<a id="audit-headers" />

### Allowed audit headers now have unremovable defaults

The [config auditing API endpoint](/vault/api-docs/system/config-auditing#create-update-audit-request-header)
tells Vault to log incoming request headers (when present) in the audit log.

Previously, Vault only logged headers that were explicitly configured for
logging. As of version 1.17, Vault automatically logs a predefined set of
[default headers](/vault/docs/audit#default-headers). By default, the header
values are not HMAC encrypted. You must explicitly configure the
[HMAC setting](/vault/api-docs/system/config-auditing#hmac) for each of the
default headers if required.

Refer to the
[audit request headers documentation](/vault/docs/audit#audit-request-headers)
for more information.

### PKI sign-intermediate now truncates notAfter field to signing issuer

Prior to 1.17.x, Vault allowed the calculated sign-intermediate `notAfter` field
to go beyond the signing issuer `notAfter` field. The extended value lead to a
CA chain that would not validate properly. As of 1.17.x, Vault truncates the
intermediary `notAfter` value to the signing issuer `notAfter` if the calculated
field is greater.

#### How to opt out

You can use the new `enforce_leaf_not_after_behavior` flag on the
sign-intermediate API along with the `leaf_not_after_behavior` flag for the
signing issuer to opt out of the truncating behavior.

When you set `enforce_leaf_not_after_behavior` to true, the sign-intermediate
API uses the `leaf_not_after_behavior` value configured for the signing issuer
to control truncation the behavior. Setting the issuer `leaf_not_after_behavior`
field to `permit` and `enforce_leaf_not_after_behavior` to true restores the
legacy behavior.

<a id="request-limiter" />

### Request limiter deprecation

Vault 1.16.0 included an experimental request limiter. The limiter was disabled
by default. Further testing indicated that an alternative approach improves
performance and reduces risk for many workloads. Vault 1.17.0 includes a
new [adaptive overload
protection](/vault/docs/concepts/adaptive-overload-protection) feature that
prevents outages when Vault is overwhelmed by write requests. Adaptive overload
protection is a beta feature in 1.17.0 and is disabled by default.

The beta request limiter will be removed from Vault entirely in a later release.

### JWT auth login requires bound audiences on the role

The `bound_audiences` parameter of "jwt" roles is **mandatory** if the JWT contains an audience
(which is more often than not the case), and **must** match at least one of
the JWT's associated `aud` claims. The `aud` claim claim can be a single string
or a list of strings as per [RFC 7519 Section 4.1.3](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7519#section-4.1.3).
If the JWT's `aud` claim is not set, then the role's `bound_audiences`
parameter is not required.

Users may not be able to log into Vault if the JWT role is configured
incorrectly. For additional details, refer to the
[JWT auth method (API)](/vault/api-docs/auth/jwt) documentation.
