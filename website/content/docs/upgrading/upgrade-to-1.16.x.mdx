# Overview

The Vault 1.16.x upgrade guide contains information on deprecations, important
or breaking changes, and remediation recommendations for anyone upgrading from
Vault 1.15. **Please read carefully**.

## Plugin environment variables

Starting in 1.16.0, plugin-specific environment variables take precedence when
they conflict with the main Vault process' environment.

For example, if an external plugin is registered with `SOURCE=child` in the
[env](/vault/api-docs/system/plugins-catalog#env) parameter, but the main Vault
process has `SOURCE=parent` in its environment, versions prior to 1.16.0 will
start the plugin process with `SOURCE=parent`. 1.16.0+ will start the plugin
process with `SOURCE=child`.

For any users relying on the old behavior, you can opt out of this change by setting
`VAULT_PLUGIN_USE_LEGACY_ENV_LAYERING=true` for the main Vault process. If this
flag is detected, Vault will continue to prioritize Vault process environment
variables when there is a conflict. Additionally, during unseal Vault will enumerate
all plugins in the catalog and print a warning for any plugins whose environment
conflicts with the main process. If the flag is set and you see an informational
log that there are no conflicts, the flag can safely be removed.

Note that containerized plugins do not inherit any environment variables from
the main Vault process, so are unaffected. Builtin plugins and external plugins
that do not specify additional environment variables are also unaffected.

See [plugin management](/vault/docs/plugins/plugin-management) for more details
on plugin environment variables.
