# Overview

The Vault 1.16.x upgrade guide contains information on deprecations, important
or breaking changes, and remediation recommendations for anyone upgrading from
Vault 1.15. **Please read carefully**.

## Important changes

### External plugin variables take precedence over system variables ((#external-plugin-variables))

Vault gives precedence to plugin environment variables over system environment
variables when loading external plugins. The behavior for builtin plugins and
plugins that do not specify additional environment variables is unaffected.

For example, if you register an external plugin with `SOURCE=child` in the
[env](/vault/api-docs/system/plugins-catalog#env) parameter but the main Vault
process already has `SOURCE=parent` defined, the plugin process starts
with `SOURCE=child`.

Refer to the [plugin management](/vault/docs/plugins/plugin-management) page for
more details on plugin environment variables.

<Highlight title="Avoid conflicts with containerized plugins">

  Containerized plugins do not inherit system-defined environment variables. As
  a result, containerized plugins cannot have conflicts with Vault environment
  variables.

</Highlight>

#### How to opt out

To opt out of the precedence change, set the
`VAULT_PLUGIN_USE_LEGACY_ENV_LAYERING` environment variable to `true` for the
main Vault process:

```shell-session
$ export VAULT_PLUGIN_USE_LEGACY_ENV_LAYERING=true
```

Setting `VAULT_PLUGIN_USE_LEGACY_ENV_LAYERING` to `true` tells Vault to:

1. prioritize environment variables from the Vault server environment whenever
   the system detects a variable conflict.
1. report on plugin variable conflicts during the unseal process by printing
   warnings for plugins with conflicting environment variables or logging an
   informational entry when there are no conflicts.

For example, assume you set `VAULT_PLUGIN_USE_LEGACY_ENV_LAYERING` to `true`
and have an environment variable `SOURCE=parent`.

If you register an external plugin called `myplugin` with `SOURCE=child`, the
plugin process starts with `SOURCE=parent` and Vault reports a conflict for
`myplugin`.

### LDAP auth entity alias names no longer include upndomain

The `userattr` field on the LDAP auth config is now used as the entity alias.
Prior to 1.16, the LDAP auth method would detect if `upndomain` was configured
on the mount and then use `<cn>@<upndomain>` as the entity alias value.

The consequence of not configuring this correctly means users may not have the
correct policies attached to their tokens when logging in.

#### How to opt out

To opt out of the entity alias change, update the `userattr` field on the config:

```
userattr="userprincipalname"
```

Refer to the [LDAP auth method (API)](/vault/api-docs/auth/ldap) page for
more details on the configuration.

### Secrets Sync now requires setting a one-time flag before use

To use the Secrets Sync feature, the feature must be activated with a new one-time
operation called an activation-flag. The feature is gated until a Vault operator
decides to trigger the flag. More information can be found in the
[secrets sync documentation](/vault/docs/sync#activating-the-feature).
