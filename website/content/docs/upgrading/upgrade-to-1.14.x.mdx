# Upgrade to Vault 1.14.x

The Vault 1.14.x upgrade guide contains information on deprecations, important
or breaking changes, and remediation recommendations for anyone upgrading from
Vault 1.13. **Please read carefully**.

## Feature deprecations and EOL

### Duplicative Docker images

As of Vault 1.14 we will no longer update the the `vault` Docker image.
Only the [Verified Publisher](https://hub.docker.com/r/hashicorp/vault)
`hashicorp/vault` image will be updated on DockerHub.

Users of [Official Images](https://hub.docker.com/_/vault) need to use
`docker pull hashicorp/vault:<version>` instead of `docker pull vault:<version>`
to get newer versions of Vault in Docker images. Currently, HashiCorp publishes
and updates identical Docker images of Vault as Verified Publisher and
Official images separately.

## Important changes

`vault.raft_storage.bolt.write.time` has been corrected from a summary to a counter to more accurately reflect that it
is measuring cumulative time writing, and not the distribution of individual write times.

### Application of Sentinel Role Governing Policies (RGPs) via identity groups

@include 'application-of-sentinel-rgps-via-identity-groups.mdx'

### Activity Log Changes

#### Disable client counting activity

License utilization cannot be reported if client counting is disabled. 

As of Vault Enterprise 1.14.10 and later, client counting cannot be disabled using `/sys/internal/counters/config` endpoint as manual license utilization reporting is always enabled.

As of Vault Enterprise 1.14.0 and later, client counting cannot be disabled using `/sys/internal/counters/config` endpoint when automated license utilization reporting is enabled.
