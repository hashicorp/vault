# Overview

This page contains the list of deprecations and important or breaking changes
for Vault 1.8.x compared to 1.7. Please read it carefully.

## License Enhancements

Licenses and EULA enhancements have been introduced in the Vault 1.8 release.
These changes are important for Enterprise customers to review. They do not affect
OSS users. Please see the [License](/vault/docs/enterprise/license) documentation for more details.

## Deprecations

The following API endpoints have been deprecated and will be removed in a future release:

* `sys/license` to manage licenses in storage; it is recommended to use
   [License Autoloading](/vault/docs/enterprise/license/autoloading) instead.

* `/gcp/token/:roleset` and `/gcp/key/:roleset` paths for generating secrets for rolesets
  in GCP Secrets. Use `/gcp/roleset/:roleset/token` and `/gcp/roleset/:roleset/key` instead.

-> **Note:** Policies containing globs should be avoided when giving users read access
to `/gcp/roleset` to avoid giving users permissions to generate tokens.

## Go Version

Vault 1.8.0 is built with Go 1.16. Please review the [Go Release
Notes](https://golang.org/doc/go1.16) for full details. Of particular note:

- Go 1.16 has added support for darwin/arm64. Vault binaries for this platform are
  now available supporting the Apple M1 CPU.

@include 'alpine-314.mdx'

@include 'entity-alias-mapping.mdx'

@include 'pki-forwarding-bug.mdx'

## Known Issues

@include 'raft-panic-old-tls-key.mdx'

### MSSQL integrations

MSSQL integrations (storage and secrets engine) will crash with a "panic: not implemented" error ([#12830](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/issues/12830)). This affects Vault versions
  1.8.0 and up. It will be fixed in the next minor update.

### Vault Enterprise binaries

Vault Enterprise binaries for `arm64` architectures will crash immediately when using production-ready storage backends.  This issue is addressed in Vault 1.8.1.

### AWS auth

AWS Auth using the [EC2 method](/vault/docs/auth/aws#ec2-auth-method) fails with the error `failed to verify the signature`. This effects 1.8.0 and 1.8.1 and there is not a workaround. The issue was fixed in Vault 1.8.2.

### Configuration files in RedHat packages

Configuration files in RedHat packages for Vault were not properly flagged as config files for `fpm`, causing user-edited files on disk to be replaced with
the defaults when a new package was installed. This [issue](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/issues/12275) affects RedHat packages for Vault 1.8.0 and the 1.8.1-0 package, and is fixed in 1.8.1-1 and up.

### Introduction of rolesets

The introduction of `/gcp/roleset/:roleset/token` and `/gcp/roleset/:roleset/key` could inadvertently give users the ability to generate tokens and key if globs are used in policies. To avoid issues like this, globs should be avoided in policies to help adhere to the principle of least privilege. See the [roleset documentation](/vault/docs/secrets/gcp#rolesets) for more information.
