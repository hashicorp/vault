# Anonymous product usage reporting

@include 'alerts/enterprise-only.mdx'

HashiCorp collects usage data about how Vault clusters are being used. Product usage
data is not used for billing or and is numerical only, and no sensitive information of
any nature is being collected. The data is collected as part of
the [license utilization reporting](/vault/docs/enterprise/license/utilization-reporting)
process and managed in a compliant manner. If automated reporting is enabled, this
data will be collected automatically.
If automated reporting is disabled, then this will be collected as part of the manual reports.

## Opt out

While none of the collected usage metrics are sensitive in any way, if you are still concerned
about these usage metrics being reported, then you can opt-out of them being collected.

If you are considering opting out because you’re worried about the data, we
strongly recommend that you review the [usage metrics list](#usage-metrics-list)
before opting out. If you have concerns with any of the automatically-reported
data please bring them to your account manager.

You have two options to opt out of product usage collection:

- HCL configuration (recommended)
- Environment variable (requires restart)


#### HCL configuration

Opting out in your product's configuration file doesn't require a system
restart, and is the method we recommend. Add the following block to your server
configuration file (e.g. `vault-config.hcl`).

```hcl
reporting {
  disable_product_usage_reporting = true
}
```

<Warning>

  When you have a cluster, each node must have the reporting stanza in its
  configuration to be consistent. In the event of leadership change, nodes will
  use its server configuration to determine whether or not to opt-out the
  product usage collection. Inconsistent configuration between nodes will change the
  reporting status upon active unseal.

</Warning>


You will find the following entries in the server log.

<CodeBlockConfig hideClipboard>

  ```
  [DEBUG] activity: there is no reporting agent configured, skipping counts reporting
  ```

</CodeBlockConfig>

#### Environment variable

If you need to, you can also opt out using an environment variable, which will
provide a startup message confirming that you have product usage data collection.
This option requires a system restart.

<Note>

  If the reporting stanza exists in the configuration file, the
  `OPTOUT_PRODUCT_USAGE_REPORTING` value overrides the configuration.

</Note>

Set the following environment variable.

```shell-session
$ export OPTOUT_PRODUCT_USAGE_REPORTING=true
```

Now, restart your [Vault servers](/vault/docs/commands/server) from the shell
where you set the environment variable.

You will find the following entries in the server log.

<CodeBlockConfig hideClipboard>

  ```
  [DEBUG] core: product usage reporting disabled
  ```

</CodeBlockConfig>

If your configuration file and environment variable differ, the environment
variable setting will take precedence.

## Usage metrics list

HashiCorp collects the following product usage metrics as part of the `metrics` part of the
[JSON payload that it collects for licence utilization](/vault/docs/enterprise/license/utilization-reporting#example-payloads).
All of these metrics are numerical, and contain no sensitive values or additional metadata:
