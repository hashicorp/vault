# Audit devices

Audit devices are the components in Vault that collectively keep a detailed log of all
requests to Vault, and their responses. Because every operation with Vault is an API
request/response, when using a single audit device, the audit log contains _every_ interaction with
the Vault API, including errors - except for a few paths which do not go via the audit system.

The non-audited paths are:

    sys/init
    sys/seal-status
    sys/seal
    sys/step-down
    sys/unseal
    sys/leader
    sys/health
    sys/rekey/init
    sys/rekey/update
    sys/rekey/verify
    sys/rekey-recovery-key/init
    sys/rekey-recovery-key/update
    sys/rekey-recovery-key/verify
    sys/storage/raft/bootstrap
    sys/storage/raft/join
    sys/internal/ui/feature-flags

and also, if the relevant listener configuration settings allow unauthenticated access:

    sys/metrics
    sys/pprof/*
    sys/in-flight-req

## Enabling multiple devices

When multiple audit devices are enabled, Vault will attempt to send the audit
logs to all of them. This allows you to not only have redundant copies, but also
a way to check for data tampering in the logs themselves.

Vault considers a request to be successful if it can log to *at least* one
configured audit device (see: [Blocked Audit
Devices](/vault/docs/audit#blocked-audit-devices) section below).  Therefore in order
to build a complete picture of all audited actions, use the aggregate/union of
the logs from each audit device.

~> Note: It is **highly recommended** that you configure Vault to use multiple audit
devices. Audit failures can prevent Vault from servicing requests, so it is
important to provide at least one other device.


## Format

Each line in the audit log is a JSON object. The `type` field specifies what
type of object it is. Currently, only two types exist: `request` and `response`.
The line contains all of the information for any given request and response. By
default, all the sensitive information is first hashed before logging in the
audit logs.

## Sensitive information

The audit logs contain the full request and response objects for every
interaction with Vault. The request and response can be matched utilizing a
unique identifier assigned to each request.

Most strings contained within requests and responses are hashed with a salt using HMAC-SHA256.
The purpose of the hash is so that secrets aren't in plaintext within your audit logs.
However, you're still able to check the value of secrets by generating HMACs yourself;
this can be done with the audit device's hash function and salt by using the `/sys/audit-hash`
API endpoint (see the documentation for more details).

~> Currently, only strings that come from JSON or returned in JSON are
HMAC'd. Other data types, like integers, booleans, and so on, are passed
through in plaintext. We recommend that all sensitive data be provided as string values
inside all JSON sent to Vault (i.e., that integer values are provided in quotes).

While most strings are hashed, Vault can be configured to make some exceptions.
For example in auth methods and secrets engines, users can enable additional exceptions
using the [secrets enable](/vault/docs/commands/secrets/enable) command, and then
[tune](/vault/docs/commands/secrets/tune) it afterward.

**see also**:

[auth enable](/vault/docs/commands/auth/enable)

[auth tune](/vault/docs/commands/auth/tune)

## Audit request headers

Use the [Vault API](/vault/api-docs/system/config-auditing) to configure request
headers to monitor and audit headers in incoming client request.

By default, Vault **does not** encrypt request header values with HMAC if you
[create](/vault/api-docs/system/config-auditing#create-update-audit-request-header)
an exception to allow request headers in the audit log. To encrypt the header
values, you must [configure](/vault/api-docs/system/config-auditing#hmac) the
relevant headers individually.

### Default headers


To help correlate requests across distributed systems, Vault automatically
records the following headers in the audit log:

- `correlation-id`
- `x-correlation-id`


To ensure Vault uses HMAC on the header values during logging, set the `hmac` value to true for the `config/auditing/request-headers` API call.

For example, to enable HMAC for `correlation-id`

```shell
curl \
    --header "X-Vault-Token: ..." \
    http://127.0.0.1:8200/v1/sys/config/auditing/request-headers/correlation-id \
    --data '{ "hmac": true }'
```


## Enabling/Disabling audit devices

When a Vault server is first initialized, no auditing is enabled. Audit
devices must be enabled by a root user using `vault audit enable`.

When enabling an audit device, options can be passed to it to configure it.
For example, the command below enables the file audit device:

```shell-session
$ vault audit enable file file_path=/var/log/vault_audit.log
```

In the command above, we passed the "file_path" parameter to specify the path
where the audit log will be written to. Each audit device has its own
set of parameters. See the documentation to the left for more details.

~> Note: Audit device configuration is replicated to all nodes within a
cluster by default, and to performance/DR secondaries for Vault Enterprise clusters.
Before enabling an audit device, ensure that all nodes within the cluster(s)
will be able to successfully log to the audit device to avoid Vault being
blocked from serving requests.
An audit device can be limited to only within the node's cluster with the [`local`](/vault/api-docs/system/audit#local) parameter.

When an audit device is disabled, it will stop receiving logs immediately.
The existing logs that it did store are untouched.

~> Note: Once an audit device is disabled, you will no longer be able to HMAC values
for comparison with entries in the audit logs. This is true even if you re-enable
the audit device at the same path, as a new salt will be created for hashing.

## Blocked audit devices

Audit device logs are critically important and ignoring auditing failures opens an avenue for attack. Vault will not respond to requests when no enabled audit devices can record them.

Vault can distinguish between two types of audit device failures.

- A blocking failure is one where an attempt to write to the audit device never completes. This is unlikely with a local disk device, but could occure with a network-based audit device.

- When multiple audit devices are enabled, if any of them fail in a non-blocking fashion, Vault requests can still complete successfully provided at least one audit device successfully writes the audit record. If any of the audit devices fail in a blocking fashion however, Vault requests will hang until the blocking is resolved.

In other words, Vault will not complete any requests until the blocked audit device can write.

Refer to [Blocked Audit Devices](/vault/tutorials/monitoring/blocked-audit-devices) for a step-by-step tutorial.

## API

Audit devices also have a full HTTP API. Please see the [Audit device API
docs](/vault/api-docs/system/audit) for more details.

## Common configuration options

@include 'audit-options-common.mdx'

## Eliding list response bodies

Some Vault responses can be very large. Primarily, this affects list operations -
as Vault lacks pagination in its APIs, listing a very large collection can result
in a response that is tens of megabytes long. Some audit backends are unable to
process individual audit records of larger sizes.

The contents of the response for a list operation is often not very interesting;
most contain only a "keys" field, containing a list of IDs. Select API endpoints
additionally return a "key_info" field, a map from ID to some additional
information about the list entry - `identity/entity/id/` is an example of this.
Even in this case, the response to a list operation is usually less-confidential
or public information, for which having the full response in the audit logs is of
lesser importance.

The `elide_list_responses` audit option provides the flexibility to not write the
full list response data from the audit log, to mitigate the creation of very long
individual audit records.

When enabled, it affects only audit records of `type=response` and
`request.operation=list`. The values of `response.data.keys` and
`response.data.key_info` will be replaced with a simple integer, recording how
many entries were contained in the list (`keys`) or map (`key_info`) - therefore
even with this feature enabled, it is still possible to see how many items were
returned by a list operation.

This extra processing only affects the response data fields `keys` and `key_info`,
and only when they have the expected data types - in the event a list response
contains data outside of the usual conventions that apply to Vault list responses,
it will be left as is by this feature.

Here is an example of an audit record that has been processed by this feature
(formatted with extra whitespace, and with fields not relevant to the example
omitted):
```json
{
  "type": "response",
  "request": {
    "operation": "list"
  },
  "response": {
    "data": {
      "key_info": 4,
      "keys": 4
    }
  }
}
```
