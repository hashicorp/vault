# Vault 1.13.0 release notes

**Software Release date:** March 1, 2023

**Summary:** Vault Release 1.13.0 offers features and enhancements that improve
the user experience while solving critical  issues previously encountered by our
customers. We are providing an overview  of improvements in this set of  release
notes.

We encourage you to [upgrade](/vault/docs/upgrading) to the latest release of
Vault to take advantage of the new benefits provided. With this latest release,
we offer solutions to critical feature gaps that were identified previously.
Please refer to the
[Changelog](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#1130-rc1)
within the Vault release for further information on product improvements,
including a comprehensive list of bug fixes.

Some of these enhancements and changes in this release include the following:

- **PKI improvements:**
   - **Cross Cluster PKI Certificate Revocation:** Introducing a new unified
     OCSP responder and CRL builder that enables a certificate revocations and
     CRL view across clusters for a given PKI mount.
   - **PKI UI Beta:** New UI introducing cross-signing flow, overview page,
     roles and keys view.
   - **Health Checks:** Provide a health overview of PKI mounts for proactive
     actions and troubleshooting.
   - **Command Line:** Simplified CLI to discover, rotate issuers and related
     commands for PKI mounts

- **Azure Auth Improvements:**
   - **Rotate-root support:** Add the ability to rotate the root account's
     client secret defined in the auth method's configuration via the new
     `rotate-root` endpoint.
   - **Managed Identities authentication:** The auth method now allows any Azure
     resource that supports managed identities to authenticate with Vault.
   - **VMSS Flex authentication:** Add support for Virtual Machine Scale Set
     (VMSS) Flex authentication.

- **GCP Secrets Impersonated Account Support:** Add support for GCP service
  account impersonation, allowing callers to generate a GCP access token without
  requiring Vault to store or retrieve a GCP service account key for each role.
- **Managed Keys in Transit Engine:** Support for offloading Transit Key
  operations to HSMs/external KMS.
- **KMIP Secret Engine Enhancements:** Implemented Asymmetric Key Lifecycle
  Server and Advanced Cryptographic Server profiles. Added support for RSA keys
  and operations such as:  MAC, MAC Verify, Sign, Sign Verify, RNG Seed and RNG
  Retrieve.
- **Vault as a SSM:** Support is planned for an upcoming Vault PKCS#11 Provider
  version to include mechanisms for encryption, decryption, signing and
  signature verification for AES and RSA keys.
- **Replication (enterprise):** We fixed a bug that could cause a cluster to
  wind up in a permanent merkle-diff/merkle-sync loop and never enter
  stream-wals, particularly in cases of high write loads on the primary cluster.
- **Share Secrets in Independent Namespaces (enterprise):** You can now add
  users from namespaces outside a namespace hierarchy to a group in a given
  namespace hierarchy. For Vault Agent, you can now grant it access to secrets
  outside the namespace where it authenticated, and reduce the number of Agents
  you need to run.
- **User Lockout:** Vault now supports configuration to lock out users when they
  have consecutive failed login attempts. This feature is **enabled by default**
  in 1.13 for the userpass, ldap, and approle auth methods.
- **Event System (Alpha):** Vault has a new experimental event system. Events
  are currently only generated on writes to the KV secrets engine, but external
  plugins can also be updated to start generating events.
- **Kubernetes authentication plugin bug fix:** Ensures a consistent TLS
  configuration for all k8s API requests. This fixes a bug where it was possible
  for the http.Client's Transport to be missing the necessary root CAs to ensure
  that all TLS connections between the auth engine and the Kubernetes API were
  validated against the configured set of CA certificates.
- **Kubernetes Secretes Engine on Vault UI:** Introducing Kubernetes secret
  engine support on the UI
- **Client Count UI improvements:** Combining current month and previous history
  into one dashboard
- **OCSP Support in the TLS Certificate Auth Method:** The auth method now can
  check for revoked certificates using the OCSP protocol.
- **UI Wizard removal:** The UI Wizard has been removed from the UI since the
  information was occasionally out-of-date and did not align with the latest
  changes. A new and enhanced UI experience is planned in a future release.

- **Vault Agent improvements:**
   - Auto-auth introduced `token_file` method which reads an existing token from
     a file. The token file method is designed for development and testing. It
     is not suitable for production deployment.
   - Listeners for the Vault Agent can define a role set to `metrics_only` so
     that a service can be configured to listen on a particular port to collect
     metrics.
   - Vault Agent can read configurations from multiple files.
   - Users can specify the log file path using the `-log-file` command flag or
     `VAULT_LOG_FILE` environment variable. This is particularly useful when
     Vault Agent is running as a Windows service.

- **OpenAPI-based Go & .NET Client Libraries (Public Beta):** Use the new Go &
  .NET client libraries to interact with the Vault API from your applications.
   - [OpenAPI-based Go client library](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault-client-go/)
   - [OpenAPI-based .NET client library](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault-client-dotnet/)

## Known issues

When Vault is configured without a TLS certificate on the TCP listener, the Vault UI may throw an error that blocks you from performing operational tasks.

The error message: `Q.randomUUID is not a function`

<Note>

Refer to this [Knowledge Base article](https://support.hashicorp.com/hc/en-us/articles/14512496697875) for more details and a workaround.

</Note>

The fix for this UI issue is coming in the Vault 1.13.1 release.
