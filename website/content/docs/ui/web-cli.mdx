# CLI emulation in the Vault GUI

The Vault GUI includes an advanced mode that uses a read–eval–print loop (REPL)
terminal to mimic basic create/read/update/delete/list (CRUDL) commands for
users who are more familiar with the Vault CLI than the GUI.

<Note title="Limited emulation">

  The Vault Web REPL terminal **is not** a full terminal emulator. You cannot
  use typical `bash` elements like environment variables, HEREDOC, or data/file
  piping unless explicitly stated otherwise.

</Note>

## Command history

The Web REPL keeps a history of all commands your enter during the current
session. Refreshing the browser window and using the `clearall` command resets
your command history.

Use the up and down arrows while the REPL prompt has focus to cycle through the
command history. Fully cycling backward, past the start of the history, wraps
around to the most recent command. Cycling forward past the most recent command
stops at an empty prompt.

## Supported commands

<Tip>

  The Web REPL terminal accepts commands with, or without, the `vault` prefix to
  ensure example commands from the Vault documentation work when pasted into
  the Web REPL terminal.

## Supported Vault CLI commands

REPL command | Associated CLI command                  | REPL differences
------------ | --------------------------------------- | ----------------------
`delete`     | [`delete`](/vault/docs/commands/delete) | None
`list`       | [`list`](/vault/docs/commands/list)     | Issues GET requests with the `?list=true` query parameter rather than `LIST` requests
`read`       | [`read`](/vault/docs/commands/read)     | None
`write`      | [`write`](/vault/docs/commands/write)   | Does not support `@` syntax to set parameters and actions that require data structures as input are not supported
`kv-get`     | [`kv get`](/vault/docs/commands/kv/get) | Only supports path syntax and KVv2 plugins, supports the `-metatdata` flag as shorthand for `-field=metadata`
