# Vault GUI browser support

Using the Vault GUI with an unsupported browser can degrade functionality for
some features and render others nonfunctional. We strongly encourage using the
latest version one of the following, supported browsers:

- [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome)
- [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/firefox)
- [Safari](https://www.apple.com/safari)
- [Microsoft Edge](https://www.microsoft.com/edge)

Some GUI features, such as the
[clipboard](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Clipboard), also
require a [secure context](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Secure_Contexts)
to function properly. We strongly recommend enabling TLS to ensure functionality
that requires a secure context behaves as expected.
