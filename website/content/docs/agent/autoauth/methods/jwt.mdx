# Vault agent Auto-Auth JWT method

The `jwt` method reads in a JWT from a file and sends it to the [JWT Auth
method](/vault/docs/auth/jwt).

## Configuration

- `path` `(string: required)` - The path to the JWT file

- `role` `(string: required)` - The role to authenticate against on Vault

- `remove_jwt_after_reading` `(bool: optional, defaults to true)` -
  This can be set to `false` to disable the default behavior of removing the
  JWT after it's been read.
