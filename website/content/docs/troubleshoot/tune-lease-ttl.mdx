# Tune the lease time-to-live (TTL)

The benefit of using Vault's dynamic secrets engines and auth methods is the
ability to control how long the Vault-managed credentials (leases) remain valid.
Often times, you generate short-lived credentials or tokens to reduce the risk
of unauthorized attacks caused by leaked credentials or tokens. If you do not
explicitly specify the time-to-live (TTL), Vault generates leases with TTL of 32
days by default.

For example, you enabled AppRole auth method at `approle`, and create a role
named `read-only` with max lease TTL of **120 days**.

```shell-session
$ vault write auth/approle/role/read-only token_policies="read-only" \
    token_ttl=90d token_max_ttl=120d
```

The command returns a warning about the TTL exceeding the mount's max TTL value.

<CodeBlockConfig hideClipboard>

```plaintext
WARNING! The following warnings were returned from Vault:

  * token_max_ttl is greater than the backend mount's maximum TTL value;
  issued tokens' max TTL value will be truncated
```

</CodeBlockConfig>


Therefore, it will return a client token with TTL of 768 hours (32 days) instead
of 120 days.

<CodeBlockConfig highlight="12" hideClipboard>

```shell-session
$ vault write auth/approle/login role_id=<ROLE_ID> secret_id=<SECRET_ID>

WARNING! The following warnings were returned from Vault:

  * TTL of "2880h" exceeded the effective max_ttl of "768h"; TTL value is
  capped accordingly

## Max lease TTL on an auth mount

You cannot set the TTL for a role to go beyond the max lease TTL set on the
AppRole auth mount (`approle` in this example). The default lease TTL and max
lease TTL are 32 days (768 hours).

```shell-session
$ vault read sys/auth/approle/tune
```

**Output:**

<CodeBlockConfig highlight="3,6" hideClipboard>

```plaintext
Key                  Value
---                  -----
default_lease_ttl    768h
description          n/a
force_no_cache       false
max_lease_ttl        768h
token_type           default-service
```

</CodeBlockConfig>

If the desired max lease TTL is 120 days (2880 hours), update the max lease TTL
on the mount.

```shell-session
$ vault auth tune -max-lease-ttl=120d approle
```

The following command lists all available parameters that you can tune.

```shell-session
$ vault auth tune -h
```

Now, the AppRole will generate a lease with token duration of 120 days (2880 hours).

<CodeBlockConfig highlight="7" hideClipboard>

```shell-session
$ vault write auth/approle/login role_id=<ROLE_ID> secret_id=<SECRET_ID>

## Max lease TTL on a secrets mount

Similar to the AppRole auth method example, you can tune the max lease TTL on
dynamic secrets.

For example, you enabled database secrets engine at `mongodb` and create a role
named `tester` with max lease TTL of 120 days (2880 hours). When you request a
database credential for the `tester` role, it returns a warning, and its lease
duration is 32 days (768 hours) instead of 120 days.

<CodeBlockConfig hideClipboard highlight="11">

```shell-session
$ vault read mongodb/creds/tester

WARNING! The following warnings were returned from Vault:

  * TTL of "2880h" exceeded the effective max_ttl of "768h"; TTL value is
  capped accordingly

Key                Value
---                -----
lease_id           mongodb/creds/tester/fVPt15506k3UW9n4pq0kIpBH
lease_duration     768h
lease_renewable    true
password           Eskkx6yRhAN4--H9WL7B
username           v-token-tester-6BtY903qOZBpzYa4yQs8-1724715513
```

</CodeBlockConfig>

To set the desired TTL on the role, tune the max lease TTL on the `mongodb`
mount.

```shell-session
$ vault secrets tune -max-lease-ttl=120d mongodb
```

Verify the configured max lease TTL available on the mount.

<CodeBlockConfig hideClipboard highlight="8">

```shell-session
$ vault read sys/mounts/mongodb/tune

Key                  Value
---                  -----
default_lease_ttl    768h
description          n/a
force_no_cache       false
max_lease_ttl        2880h
```

</CodeBlockConfig>

The following command lists all available parameters that you can tune.

```shell-session
$ vault secrets tune -h
```

When you introduce Vault into your existing system, the existing applications
may not be able to handle short-lived leases. You can tune the default TTLs
on each mount.

On the similar note, if the system default of 32 days is too long, you can tune
the default TTL to be shorter to comply with your organization's policy.
