# Highly Available Vault Cluster with Consul

~> **Important Note:** This chart is not compatible with Helm 2. Please use Helm 3.6+ with this chart.

The below `values.yaml` can be used to set up a five server Vault cluster using
Consul as a highly available storage backend, Google Cloud KMS for Auto Unseal.

```yaml
server:
  extraEnvironmentVars:
    GOOGLE_REGION: global
    GOOGLE_PROJECT: myproject
    GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS: /vault/userconfig/my-gcp-iam/myproject-creds.json

  extraVolumes:
    - type: secret
      name: my-gcp-iam

  affinity: |
    podAntiAffinity:
      requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
        - labelSelector:
            matchLabels:
              app: {{ template "vault.name" . }}
              release: "{{ .Release.Name }}"
              component: server
          topologyKey: kubernetes.io/hostname

  service:
    enabled: true

  ha:
    enabled: true
    replicas: 5

    config: |
      ui = true

      listener "tcp" {
        tls_disable = 1
        address = "[::]:8200"
        cluster_address = "[::]:8201"
      }

      storage "consul" {
        path = "vault"
        address = "HOST_IP:8500"
      }

      seal "gcpckms" {
         project     = "myproject"
         region      = "global"
         key_ring    = "vault-unseal-kr"
         crypto_key  = "vault-unseal-key"
      }

      service_registration "kubernetes" {}
```
