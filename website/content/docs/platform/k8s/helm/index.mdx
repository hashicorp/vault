# Helm chart

@include 'helm/version.mdx'

The [Vault Helm chart](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault-helm)
is the recommended way to install and configure Vault on Kubernetes.
In addition to running Vault itself, the Helm chart is the primary
method for installing and configuring Vault to integrate with other
services such as Consul for High Availability (HA) deployments.

This page assumes general knowledge of [Helm](https://helm.sh/) and
how to use it. Using Helm to install Vault requires that Helm is
properly installed and configured with your Kubernetes cluster.

@include 'kubernetes-supported-versions.mdx'

## Using the helm chart

Helm must be installed and configured on your machine. Please refer to the [Helm
documentation](https://helm.sh/) or the [Vault Installation to Minikube via
Helm](/vault/tutorials/kubernetes/kubernetes-minikube-consul) tutorial.

To use the Helm chart, add the Hashicorp helm repository and check that you have
access to the chart:

@include 'helm/repo.mdx'

-> **Important:** The Helm chart is new and under significant development.
Please always run Helm with `--dry-run` before any install or upgrade to verify
changes.

Example chart usage:

Installing the latest release of the Vault Helm chart with pods prefixed with
the name `vault`.

```shell-session
$ helm install vault hashicorp/vault
```

Installing a specific version of the chart.

@include 'helm/install.mdx'

~> **Security Warning:** By default, the chart runs in standalone mode. This
mode uses a single Vault server with a file storage backend. This is a less
secure and less resilient installation that is **NOT** appropriate for a
production setup. It is highly recommended to use a [properly secured Kubernetes
cluster](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/securing-a-cluster/),
[learn the available configuration
options](/vault/docs/platform/k8s/helm/configuration), and read the [production deployment
checklist](/vault/docs/platform/k8s/helm/run#architecture).


<Important title="Helm chart provisions ALB on AWS side">

  If you use AWS features (e.g, AWS PrivateLink) that require a network load
  balancer (NLB), you must provision your NLB **before** your application load 
  balancer (ALB).

Refer to the [Kubernetes](/vault/tutorials/kubernetes)
tutorials series to learn how to run Vault on Kubernetes.
