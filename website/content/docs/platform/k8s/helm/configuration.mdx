# Configuration

@include 'helm/version.mdx'

The chart is highly customizable using
[Helm configuration values](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/using_helm/#customizing-the-chart-before-installing).
Each value has a default tuned for an optimal getting started experience
with Vault. Before going into production, please review the parameters below
and consider if they're appropriate for your deployment.

- `global` - These global values affect multiple components of the chart.

  - `enabled` (`boolean: true`) - The master enabled/disabled configuration. If this is true, most components will be installed by default. If this is false, no components will be installed by default and manually opting-in is required, such as by setting `server.enabled` to true.

  - `namespace` (`string: ""`) - The namespace to deploy to. Defaults to the `helm` installation namespace.

  - `imagePullSecrets` (`array: []`) - References secrets to be used when pulling images from private registries. See [Pull an Image from a Private Registry](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/pull-image-private-registry/) for more details. May be specified as an array of name map entries or just as an array of names:

    ```yaml
    imagePullSecrets:
      - name: image-pull-secret
    # or
    imagePullSecrets:
      - image-pull-secret
    ```

  - `tlsDisable` (`boolean: true`) - When set to `true`, changes URLs from `https` to `http` (such as the `VAULT_ADDR=http://127.0.0.1:8200` environment variable set on the Vault pods).

  - `externalVaultAddr` (`string: ""`) - External vault server address for the injector and CSI provider to use. Setting this will disable deployment of a vault server. A service account with token review permissions is automatically created if `server.serviceAccount.create=true` is set for the external Vault server to use.

  - `openshift` (`boolean: false`) - If `true`, enables configuration specific to OpenShift such as NetworkPolicy, SecurityContext, and Route.

  - `psp` - Values that configure Pod Security Policy.

    - `enable` (`boolean: false`) - When set to `true`, enables Pod Security Policies for Vault and Vault Agent Injector.

    - `annotations` (`dictionary: {}`) - This value defines additional annotations to
      add to the Pod Security Policies. This can either be YAML or a YAML-formatted
      multi-line templated string.

      ```yaml
      annotations:
        seccomp.security.alpha.kubernetes.io/allowedProfileNames: docker/default,runtime/default

  - `resources` (`dictionary: {}`) - The resource requests and limits (CPU, memory, etc.) for each container of the injector. This should be a YAML dictionary of a Kubernetes [resource](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/manage-resources-containers/) object. If this isn't specified, then the pods won't request any specific amount of resources, which limits the ability for Kubernetes to make efficient use of compute resources.<br /> **Setting this is highly recommended.**

    ```yaml
    resources:
      requests:
        memory: '256Mi'
        cpu: '250m'
      limits:

    ```

  - `webhook` - Values that control the Mutating Webhook Configuration.

    - `failurePolicy` (`string: "Ignore"`) - Configures failurePolicy of the webhook. To block pod creation while the webhook is unavailable, set the policy to `"Fail"`. See [Failure Policy](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/extensible-admission-controllers/#failure-policy).

    - `timeoutSeconds` (`int: 30`) - Specifies the number of seconds before the webhook request will be ignored or fails. If it is ignored or fails depends on the `failurePolicy`. See [timeouts](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/extensible-admission-controllers/#timeouts).

    - `namespaceSelector` (`object: {}`) - The selector used by the admission webhook controller to limit what namespaces where injection can happen. If unset, all non-system namespaces are eligible for injection. See [Matching requests: namespace selector](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/extensible-admission-controllers/#matching-requests-namespaceselector).

      ```yaml
      namespaceSelector:
        matchLabels:
          sidecar-injector: enabled
      ```

    - `objectSelector` (`object: {}`) - The selector used by the admission webhook controller to limit what objects can be affected by mutation. See [Matching requests: object selector](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/extensible-admission-controllers/#matching-requests-objectselector).

    ```

  - `certs` - The certs section configures how the webhook TLS certs are configured. These are the TLS certs for the Kube apiserver communicating to the webhook. By default, the injector will generate and manage its own certs, but this requires the ability for the injector to update its own `MutatingWebhookConfiguration`. In a production environment, custom certs should probably be used. Configure the values below to enable this.

    - `secretName` (`string: ""`) - secretName is the name of the Kubernetes secret that has the TLS certificate and private key to serve the injector webhook. If this is null, then the injector will default to its automatic management mode.

    - `caBundle` (`string: ""`) - The PEM-encoded CA public certificate bundle for the TLS certificate served by the injector. This must be specified as a string and can't come from a secret because it must be statically configured on the Kubernetes `MutatingAdmissionWebhook` resource. This only needs to be specified if `secretName` is not null.

    - `certName` (`string: "tls.crt"`) - The name of the certificate file within the `secretName` secret.

    ```

  - `affinity` - This value defines the [affinity](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/assign-pod-node/#affinity-and-anti-affinity) for Vault Agent Injector pods. This can either be multi-line string or YAML matching the PodSpec's affinity field. It defaults to allowing only a single pod on each node, which minimizes risk of the cluster becoming unusable if a node is lost. If you need to run more pods per node (for example, testing on Minikube), set this value to `null`.

    ```yaml
    # Recommended default server affinity:
    affinity: |
      podAntiAffinity:
        requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
        - labelSelector:
            matchLabels:

    - `instanceSelector`

      - `enabled` (`boolean: true`) - When set to false, the service selector used for the vault, vault-active, and vault-standby services will not filter on `app.kubernetes.io/instance`. This means they may select pods from outside this deployment of the Helm chart. Does not affect the headless vault-internal service with `ClusterIP: None`.

    - `annotations` (`dictionary: {}`) - This value defines additional annotations for the service. This can either be YAML or a YAML-formatted multi-line templated string.

    ```yaml

    - `createSecret` (`boolean: false`): Create a Kubernetes Secret object to store a non-expiring token for the service account. Prior to Kubernetes 1.24.0, Kubernetes used to generate this secret for each service account by default. Kubernetes recommends using short-lived tokens from the TokenRequest API or projected volumes instead if possible. For more details, see https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/#service-account-token-secrets. `server.serviceAccount.create` must be equal to 'true' in order to use this feature.

    - `annotations` (`dictionary: {}`) - This value defines additional annotations for the service account. This can either be YAML or a YAML-formatted multi-line templated string.

          address = "HOST_IP:8500"
      }
    ```

    This can also be set using Helm's `--set` flag (vault-helm v0.1.0 and later), using the following syntax:

      computed based on the `server.replicas` value to be `(n/2)-1`. If you need to set
      this to `0`, you will need to add a `--set 'server.disruptionBudget.maxUnavailable=0'`
      flag to the helm chart installation command because of a limitation in the Helm
      templating language.
