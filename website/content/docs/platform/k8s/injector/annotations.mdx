# Annotations

The following are the available annotations for the injector. These annotations
are organized into two sections: agent and vault. All of the annotations below
change the configurations of the Vault Agent containers injected into the pod.

## Agent annotations

Agent annotations change the Vault Agent containers templating configuration. For
example, agent annotations allow users to define what secrets they want, how to render
them, optional commands to run, etc.

- `vault.hashicorp.com/agent-inject` - configures whether injection is explicitly
  enabled or disabled for a pod. This should be set to a `true` or `false` value.
  Defaults to `false`.

- `vault.hashicorp.com/agent-inject-status` - blocks further mutations
  by adding the value `injected` to the pod after a successful mutation.

- `vault.hashicorp.com/agent-configmap` - name of the configuration map where Vault
  Agent configuration file and templates can be found.

- `vault.hashicorp.com/agent-image` - name of the Vault docker image to use. This
  value overrides the default image configured in the injector and is usually
  not needed. Defaults to `hashicorp/vault:1.17.2`.

- `vault.hashicorp.com/agent-init-first` - configures the pod to run the Vault Agent
  init container first if `true` (last if `false`). This is useful when other init
  containers need pre-populated secrets. This should be set to a `true` or `false`
  value. Defaults to `false`.

- `vault.hashicorp.com/agent-inject-command` - configures Vault Agent
  to run a command after the template has been rendered. To map a command to a specific
  secret, use the same unique secret name: `vault.hashicorp.com/agent-inject-command-SECRET-NAME`.
  For example, if a secret annotation `vault.hashicorp.com/agent-inject-secret-foobar`
  is configured, `vault.hashicorp.com/agent-inject-command-foobar` would map a command
  to that secret.

- `vault.hashicorp.com/agent-inject-secret` - configures Vault Agent
  to retrieve the secrets from Vault required by the container. The name of the
  secret is any unique string after `vault.hashicorp.com/agent-inject-secret-`,
  such as `vault.hashicorp.com/agent-inject-secret-foobar`. The value is the path
  in Vault where the secret is located.

- `vault.hashicorp.com/agent-inject-template` - configures the template Vault Agent
  should use for rendering a secret. The name of the template is any
  unique string after `vault.hashicorp.com/agent-inject-template-`, such as
  `vault.hashicorp.com/agent-inject-template-foobar`. This should map to the same
  unique value provided in `vault.hashicorp.com/agent-inject-secret-`. If not provided,
  a default generic template is used.

- `vault.hashicorp.com/error-on-missing-key` - configures whether Vault Agent
  should exit with an error when accessing a struct or map field/key that does
  not exist. The name of the secret is the string after
  `vault.hashicorp.com/error-on-missing-key-`, and should map to the same unique
  value provided in `vault.hashicorp.com/agent-inject-secret-`. Defaults to
  `false`. See [Vault Agent Template Config](/vault/docs/agent-and-proxy/agent/template#template-configurations)
  for more details.

- `vault.hashicorp.com/agent-inject-containers` - comma-separated list that specifies in
  which containers the secrets volume should be mounted. If not provided, the secrets
  volume will be mounted in all containers in the pod.

- `vault.hashicorp.com/secret-volume-path` - configures where on the filesystem a secret
  will be rendered. To map a path to a specific secret, use the same unique secret name:
  `vault.hashicorp.com/secret-volume-path-SECRET-NAME`. For example, if a secret annotation
  `vault.hashicorp.com/agent-inject-secret-foobar` is configured,
  `vault.hashicorp.com/secret-volume-path-foobar` would configure where that secret
  is rendered. If no secret name is provided, this sets the default for all rendered
  secrets in the pod.

- `vault.hashicorp.com/agent-inject-file` - configures the filename and path
  in the secrets volume where a Vault secret will be written. This should be used
  with `vault.hashicorp.com/secret-volume-path`, which mounts a memory volume to
  the specified path. If `secret-volume-path` is used, the path can be omitted from
  this value. To map a filename to a specific secret, use the same unique secret name:
  `vault.hashicorp.com/agent-inject-file-SECRET-NAME`. For example, if a secret annotation
  `vault.hashicorp.com/agent-inject-secret-foobar` is configured,
  `vault.hashicorp.com/agent-inject-file-foobar` would configure the filename.

- `vault.hashicorp.com/agent-inject-perms` - configures the permissions of the
  file to create in the secrets volume. The name of the secret is the string
  after "vault.hashicorp.com/agent-inject-perms-", and should map to the same
  unique value provided in "vault.hashicorp.com/agent-inject-secret-". The value
  is the octal permission, for example: `0644`.

- `vault.hashicorp.com/agent-inject-template-file` - configures the path and filename of the
  custom template to use. This should be used with `vault.hashicorp.com/extra-secret`,
  which mounts a Kubernetes secret to `/vault/custom`. To map a template file to a specific secret,
  use the same unique secret name: `vault.hashicorp.com/agent-inject-template-file-SECRET-NAME`.
  For example, if a secret annotation `vault.hashicorp.com/agent-inject-secret-foobar` is configured,
  `vault.hashicorp.com/agent-inject-template-file-foobar` would configure the template file.

- `vault.hashicorp.com/agent-inject-default-template` - configures the default template type for rendering
  secrets if no custom template is defined. Possible values include `map` and `json`. Defaults to `map`.

- `vault.hashicorp.com/template-config-exit-on-retry-failure` - controls whether
  Vault Agent exits after it has exhausted its number of template retry attempts
  due to failures. Defaults to `true`. See [Vault Agent Template
  Config](/vault/docs/agent-and-proxy/agent/template#global-configurations) for more details.

- `vault.hashicorp.com/template-static-secret-render-interval` - If specified,
  configures how often Vault Agent Template should render non-leased secrets such as KV v2.
  See [Vault Agent Template Config](/vault/docs/agent-and-proxy/agent/template#global-configurations) for more details.

- `vault.hashicorp.com/template-max-connections-per-host` - If specified, limits
  the total number of connections that the Vault Agent templating engine can use
  for a particular Vault host. The connection limit includes all connections in the dialing,
  active, and idle states. See [Vault Agent Template Config](/vault/docs/agent-and-proxy/agent/template#global-configurations)
  for more details.

- `vault.hashicorp.com/agent-extra-secret` - mounts Kubernetes secret as a volume at
  `/vault/custom` in the sidecar/init containers. Useful for custom Agent configs with
  auto-auth methods such as approle that require paths to secrets be present.

- `vault.hashicorp.com/agent-inject-token` - configures Vault Agent to share the Vault
  token with other containers in the pod, in a file named `token` in the root of the
  secrets volume (i.e. `/vault/secrets/token`). This is helpful when other containers
  communicate directly with Vault but require auto-authentication provided by Vault
  Agent. This should be set to a `true` or `false` value. Defaults to `false`.

- `vault.hashicorp.com/agent-limits-cpu` - configures the CPU limits on the Vault
  Agent containers. Defaults to `500m`. Setting this to an empty string disables
  CPU limits.

- `vault.hashicorp.com/agent-limits-mem` - configures the memory limits on the Vault
  Agent containers. Defaults to `128Mi`. Setting this to an empty string disables
  memory limits.

- `vault.hashicorp.com/agent-limits-ephemeral` - configures the ephemeral
  storage limit on the Vault Agent containers. Defaults to unset, which
  disables ephemeral storage limits. Also available as a command-line option
  (`-ephemeral-storage-limit`) or environment variable (`AGENT_INJECT_EPHEMERAL_LIMIT`)
  to set the default for all injected Agent containers. **Note:** Pod limits are
  equal to the sum of all container limits. Setting this limit without setting it
  for other containers will also affect the limits of other containers in the pod.
  See [Kubernetes resources documentation][k8s-resources] for more details.

- `vault.hashicorp.com/agent-requests-cpu` - configures the CPU requests on the
  Vault Agent containers. Defaults to `250m`. Setting this to an empty string disables
  CPU requests.

- `vault.hashicorp.com/agent-requests-mem` - configures the memory requests on the
  Vault Agent containers. Defaults to `64Mi`. Setting this to an empty string disables
  memory requests.

- `vault.hashicorp.com/agent-requests-ephemeral` - configures the ephemeral
  storage requests on the Vault Agent Containers. Defaults to unset, which
  disables ephemeral storage requests (and will default to the ephemeral limit
  if set). Also available as a command-line option (`-ephemeral-storage-request`)
  or environment variable (`AGENT_INJECT_EPHEMERAL_REQUEST`) to set the default
  for all injected Agent containers. **Note:** Pod requests are equal to the sum
  of all container requests. Setting this limit without setting it for other
  containers will also affect the requests of other containers in the pod. See
  [Kubernetes resources documentation][k8s-resources] for more details.

- `vault.hashicorp.com/agent-revoke-on-shutdown` - configures whether the sidecar
  will revoke it's own token before shutting down. This setting will only be applied
  to the Vault Agent sidecar container. This should be set to a `true` or `false`
  value. Defaults to `false`.

- `vault.hashicorp.com/agent-revoke-grace` - configures the grace period, in seconds,
  for revoking it's own token before shutting down. This setting will only be applied
  to the Vault Agent sidecar container. Defaults to `5s`.

- `vault.hashicorp.com/agent-pre-populate` - configures whether an init container
  is included to pre-populate the shared memory volume with secrets prior to the
  containers starting. This should be set to a `true` or `false` value. Defaults
  to `true`.

- `vault.hashicorp.com/agent-pre-populate-only` - configures whether an init container
  is the only injected container. If true, no sidecar container will be injected
  at runtime of the pod. Enabling this option is recommended for workloads of
  type `CronJob` or `Job` to ensure a clean pod termination.

- `vault.hashicorp.com/preserve-secret-case` - configures Vault Agent to preserve
  the secret name case when creating the secret files. This should be set to a `true`
  or `false` value. Defaults to `false`.

- `vault.hashicorp.com/agent-run-as-user` - sets the user (uid) to run Vault
  agent as. Also available as a command-line option (`-run-as-user`) or
  environment variable (`AGENT_INJECT_RUN_AS_USER`) for the injector. Defaults
  to 100.

- `vault.hashicorp.com/agent-run-as-group` - sets the group (gid) to run Vault
  agent as. Also available as a command-line option (`-run-as-group`) or
  environment variable (`AGENT_INJECT_RUN_AS_GROUP`) for the injector. Defaults
  to 1000.

- `vault.hashicorp.com/agent-set-security-context` - controls whether
  `SecurityContext` is set in injected containers. Also available as a
  command-line option (`-set-security-context`) or environment variable
  (`AGENT_INJECT_SET_SECURITY_CONTEXT`). Defaults to `true`.

- `vault.hashicorp.com/agent-run-as-same-user` - run the injected Vault agent
  containers as the User (uid) of the first application container in the pod.
  Requires `Spec.Containers[0].SecurityContext.RunAsUser` to be set in the pod
  spec. Also available as a command-line option (`-run-as-same-user`) or
  environment variable (`AGENT_INJECT_RUN_AS_SAME_USER`). Defaults to `false`.

  ~> **Note**: If the first application container in the pod is running as root
  (uid 0), the `run-as-same-user` annotation will fail injection with an error.

- `vault.hashicorp.com/agent-share-process-namespace` - sets
  [shareProcessNamespace] in the Pod spec where Vault Agent is injected.
  Defaults to `false`.

- `vault.hashicorp.com/agent-cache-enable` - configures Vault Agent to enable
  [caching](/vault/docs/agent-and-proxy/agent/caching). In Vault 1.7+ this annotation will also enable
  a Vault Agent persistent cache. This persistent cache will be shared between the init
  and sidecar container to reuse tokens and leases retrieved by the init container.
  Defaults to `false`.

- `vault.hashicorp.com/agent-cache-use-auto-auth-token` - configures Vault Agent cache
  to authenticate on behalf of the requester. Set to `force` to enable. Disabled
  by default.

- `vault.hashicorp.com/agent-cache-listener-port` - configures Vault Agent cache
  listening port. Defaults to `8200`.

- `vault.hashicorp.com/agent-copy-volume-mounts` - copies the mounts from the specified
  container and mounts them to the Vault Agent containers. The service account volume is
  ignored.

- `vault.hashicorp.com/agent-service-account-token-volume-name` - the optional name of a projected volume containing a service account token for use with auto-auth against Vault's Kubernetes auth method. If the volume is mounted to another container in the deployment, the token volume will be mounted to the same location in the vault-agent containers. Otherwise it will be mounted at the default location of `/var/run/secrets/vault.hashicorp.com/serviceaccount/`.

- `vault.hashicorp.com/agent-enable-quit` - enable the [`/agent/v1/quit` endpoint](/vault/docs/agent-and-proxy/agent#quit) on an injected agent. This option defaults to false, and if true will be set on the existing cache listener, or a new localhost listener with a basic cache stanza configured. The [agent-cache-listener-port annotation](/vault/docs/platform/k8s/injector/annotations#vault-hashicorp-com-agent-cache-listener-port) can be used to change the port.

- `vault.hashicorp.com/agent-telemetry` - specifies the [telemetry](/vault/docs/configuration/telemetry) configuration for the
  Vault Agent sidecar. The name of the config is any unique string after
  `vault.hashicorp.com/agent-telemetry-`, such as `vault.hashicorp.com/agent-telemetry-prometheus_retention_time`.
  This annotation can be reused multiple times to configure multiple settings for the agent telemetry.

- `vault.hashicorp.com/go-max-procs` - set the `GOMAXPROCS` environment variable for injected agents

- `vault.hashicorp.com/agent-json-patch` - change the injected agent sidecar container using a [JSON patch](https://jsonpatch.com/) before it is created.
  This can be used to add, remove, or modify any attribute of the container.
  For example, setting this to `[{"op": "replace", "path": "/name", "value": "different-name"}]` will update the agent container's name to be `different-name`
  instead of the default `vault-agent`.

- `vault.hashicorp.com/agent-init-json-patch` - same as `vault.hashicorp.com/agent-json-patch`, except that the JSON patch will be applied to the
  injected init container instead.

## Vault annotations

Vault annotations change how the Vault Agent containers communicate with Vault. For
example, Vault's address, TLS certificates to use, client parameters such as timeouts,
etc.

- `vault.hashicorp.com/auth-config` - configures additional parameters for the configured
  authentication method. The name of the config is any unique string after
  `vault.hashicorp.com/auth-config-`, such as `vault.hashicorp.com/auth-config-role-id-file-path`.
  This annotation can be reused multiple times to configure multiple settings for the authentication
  method. Some authentication methods may require additional secrets and should be mounted via the
  `vault.hashicorp.com/agent-extra-secret` annotation. For a list of valid authentication configurations,
  see the Vault Agent [auto-auth documentation](/vault/docs/agent-and-proxy/autoauth/methods).

- `vault.hashicorp.com/auth-path` - configures the authentication path for the Kubernetes
  auth method. Defaults to `auth/kubernetes`.

- `vault.hashicorp.com/ca-cert` - path of the CA certificate used to verify Vault's
  TLS. This can also be set as the default for all injected Agents via the
  `AGENT_INJECT_VAULT_CACERT_BYTES` environment variable which takes a PEM-encoded
  certificate or bundle.

- `vault.hashicorp.com/ca-key` - path of the CA public key used to verify Vault's
  TLS.

- `vault.hashicorp.com/client-cert` - path of the client certificate used when
  communicating with Vault via mTLS.

- `vault.hashicorp.com/client-key` - path of the client public key used when communicating
  with Vault via mTLS.

- `vault.hashicorp.com/client-max-retries` - configures number of Vault Agent retry
  attempts when certain errors are encountered. Defaults to 2, for 3 total attempts.
  Set this to `0` or less to disable retrying. Error codes that are retried are 412
  (client consistency requirement not satisfied) and all 5xx except for 501 (not implemented).

- `vault.hashicorp.com/client-timeout` - configures the request timeout threshold,
  in seconds, of the Vault Agent when communicating with Vault. Defaults to `60s`
  and accepts value types of `60`, `60s` or `1m`.

  values are `standard` and `json`. Default is `standard`.

- `vault.hashicorp.com/namespace` - configures the Vault Enterprise namespace to
  be used when requesting secrets from Vault. Also available as a command-line
  option (`-vault-namespace`) or environment variable
  (`AGENT_INJECT_VAULT_NAMESPACE`) to set the default namespace for all injected
  Agents.

- `vault.hashicorp.com/proxy-address` - configures the HTTP proxy to use when connecting
  to a Vault server.

- `vault.hashicorp.com/role` - configures the Vault role used by the Vault Agent
  auto-auth method. Required when `vault.hashicorp.com/agent-configmap` is not set.

- `vault.hashicorp.com/service` - configures the Vault address for the injected
  Vault Agent to use. This value overrides the default Vault address configured
  in the injector, and may either be the address of a Vault service within the
  same Kubernetes cluster as the injector, or an external Vault URL.

- `vault.hashicorp.com/tls-secret` - name of the Kubernetes secret containing TLS
  Client and CA certificates and keys. This is mounted to `/vault/tls`.

- `vault.hashicorp.com/tls-server-name` - name of the Vault server to verify the
  authenticity of the server when communicating with Vault over TLS.

- `vault.hashicorp.com/tls-skip-verify` - if true, configures the Vault Agent to
  skip verification of Vault's TLS certificate. It's not recommended to set this
  value to true in a production environment.

- `vault.hashicorp.com/agent-disable-idle-connections` - Comma-separated [list
  of Vault Agent features](/vault/docs/agent-and-proxy/agent#disable_idle_connections) where idle
  connections should be disabled. Also available as a command-line option
  (`-disable-idle-connections`) or environment variable
  (`AGENT_INJECT_DISABLE_IDLE_CONNECTIONS`) to set the default for all injected
  Agents.

- `vault.hashicorp.com/agent-disable-keep-alives` - Comma-separated [list of
  Vault Agent features](/vault/docs/agent-and-proxy/agent#disable_keep_alives) where keep-alives
