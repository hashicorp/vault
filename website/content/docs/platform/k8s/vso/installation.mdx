# Installing the Vault Secrets Operator

## Prerequisites

- Kubernetes 1.22+
- Vault OSS/Enterprise 1.11+

## Installation using helm

The [Vault Secrets Operator Helm chart](/vault/docs/platform/k8s/vso/helm) is the recommended way of
installing and configuring the Vault Secrets Operator.

To install a new instance of the Vault Secrets Operator, first add the
HashiCorp helm repository and ensure you have access to the chart:

```shell-session
$ helm repo add hashicorp https://helm.releases.hashicorp.com
"hashicorp" has been added to your repositories

$ helm search repo hashicorp/vault-secrets-operator
NAME           	CHART VERSION	APP VERSION	DESCRIPTION
hashicorp/vault-secrets-operator	0.1.0-beta       	0.1.0-beta     	Official HashiCorp Vault Secrets Operator Chart
```

Then install the Operator:

```shell-session
$ helm install --create-namespace --namespace vault-secrets-operator vault-secrets-operator hashicorp/vault-secrets-operator
```


## Upgrading using helm

Upgrades may be performed with `helm upgrade` on an existing install. Please
always run Helm with `--dry-run` before any install or upgrade to verify
changes.
