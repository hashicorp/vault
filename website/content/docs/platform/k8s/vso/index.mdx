# Vault Secrets Operator

The Vault Secrets Operator (VSO) allows Pods to consume Vault secrets and HCP Vault Secrets Apps natively from Kubernetes Secrets.

## Overview

The Vault Secrets Operator operates by watching for changes to its supported set of Custom Resource Definitions (CRD).
Each CRD provides the specification required to allow the operator to synchronize from one of the supported sources for secrets to a Kubernetes Secret.
The operator writes the *source* secret data directly to the *destination* Kubernetes Secret, ensuring that any
changes made to the *source* are replicated to the *destination* over its lifetime. In this way, an application only needs
to have access to the *destination* secret in order to make use of the secret data contained within.

## Features

The following features are supported by the Vault Secrets Operator:

- Support for syncing from multiple secret sources.
- Automatic secret drift and remediation.
- Automatic secret rotation for `Deployment`, `ReplicaSet`, `StatefulSet` Kubernetes resource types.
- Prometheus specific instrumentation for [monitoring](/vault/docs/platform/k8s/vso/telemetry) the Operator.
- Support for installing using: `Helm` or `Kustomize`<br />
*see the [installation](/vault/docs/platform/k8s/vso/installation) docs for more details*

## Supported secret sources

The Vault Secrets Operator supports syncing from multiple secret sources.
