# Vault Secrets Operator

The Vault Secrets Operator (VSO) allows Pods to consume Vault secrets natively from Kubernetes Secrets.

## Overview

The Vault Secrets Operator operates by watching for changes to its supported set of Custom Resource Definitions (CRD).
Each CRD provides the specification required to allow the Operator to synchronize a Vault Secrets to a Kubernetes Secret.
The Operator writes the *source* Vault secret data directly to the *destination* Kubernetes Secret, ensuring that any
changes made to the *source* are replicated to the *destination* over its lifetime. In this way, an application only needs
to have access to the *destination* secret in order to make use of the secret data contained within.

### Features

The following features are supported by the Vault Secrets Operator:

- All Vault secret engines supported.
- TLS/mTLS communications with Vault.
- Authentication using the requesting `Pod`'s `ServiceAccount` via the [Kubernetes Auth Method](/vault/docs/auth/kubernetes).
- Syncing Vault Secrets to Kubernetes Secrets.
- Secret rotation for `Deployment`, `ReplicaSet`, `StatefulSet` Kubernetes resource types.
- Prometheus instrumentation for monitoring the Operator
- Supported installation methods: `Helm`, `Kustomize`<br />
*see the [installation](/vault/docs/platform/k8s/vso/installation.mdx) docs for more details*

## Vault Access and Custom Resource Definitions

~> **Note:** Currently, the Operator only supports the [Kubernetes Auth Method](/vault/docs/auth/kubernetes).
Over time, we will be adding support for more Vault Auth methods.

The Vault connection and authentication configuration is provided by the `VaultConnection` and `VaultAuth` CRDs. These can be considered as
foundational Custom Resources that all secret replication type resources will reference.

### VaultConnection Custom Resource

Provides the configuration necessary for the Operator to connect to a single Vault server instance.

```yaml
---
apiVersion: secrets.hashicorp.com/v1alpha1
kind: VaultConnection
metadata:
  namespace: vso-example
  name: example
spec:
  # required configuration
  # address to the Vault server.
  address: http://vault.vault.svc.cluster.local:8200

  # optional configuration
  # HTTP headers to be included in all Vault requests.
  # headers: []
  # TLS server name to use as the SNI host for TLS connections.
  # tlsServerName: ""
  # skip TLS verification for TLS connections to Vault.
  # skipTLSVerify: false
  # the trusted PEM encoded CA certificate chain stored in a Kubernetes Secret
  # caCertSecretRef: ""
```

### VaultAuth Custom Resource

Provide the configuration necessary for the Operator to authenticate to a single Vault server instance as
specified in a `VaultConnection` Custom Resource.

```yaml
---
apiVersion: secrets.hashicorp.com/v1alpha1
kind: VaultAuth
metadata:
  namespace: vso-example
  name: example
spec:
  # required configuration
  # VaultConnectionRef of the corresponding VaultConnection CustomResource.
  # If no value is specified the Operator will default to the `default` VaultConnection,
  # configured in its own Kubernetes namespace.
  vaultConnectionRef: example
  # Method to use when authenticating to Vault.
  method: kubernetes
  # Mount to use when authenticating to auth method.
  mount: kubernetes
  # Kubernetes specific auth configuration, requires that the Method be set to kubernetes.
  kubernetes:
    # role to use when authenticating to Vault
    role: example
    # ServiceAccount to use when authenticating to Vault
    # it is recommended to always provide a unique serviceAccount per Pod/application
    serviceAccount: default

  # optional configuration
  # Vault namespace where the auth backend is mounted (requires Vault Enterprise)
  # namespace: ""
  # Params to use when authenticating to Vault
  # params: []
  # HTTP headers to be included in all Vault authentication requests.
  # headers: []
```

## Vault Secret Custom Resource Definitions

Provide the configuration necessary for the Operator to replicate a single Vault Secret to a single Kubernetes Secret.
Each supported CRD is specialized to a *class* of Vault secret, documented below.

### VaultStaticSecret Custom Resource

Provides the configuration necessary for the Operator to synchronize a single Vault *static* Secret to a single Kubernetes Secret.<br />
Supported secrets engines: [kv-v2](/vault/docs/secrets/kv/kv-v2), [kv-v1](/vault/docs/secrets/kv/kv-v1)

```yaml
---
apiVersion: secrets.hashicorp.com/v1alpha1
kind: VaultStaticSecret
metadata:
  namespace: vso-example
  name: example
spec:
  vaultAuthRef: example
  mount: kvv2
  type: kv-v2
  name: secret
  refreshAfter: 60s
  destination:
    create: true
    name: static-secret1
```

### VaultPKISecret Custom Resource
Provides the configuration necessary for the Operator to synchronize a single Vault *PKI* Secret to a single Kubernetes Secret.<br />
Supported secrets engines: [pki](/vault/docs/secrets/pki)

```yaml
---
apiVersion: secrets.hashicorp.com/v1alpha1
kind: VaultPKISecret
metadata:
  namespace: vso-example
  name: example
spec:
  vaultAuthRef: example
  mount: pki
  name: default
  commonName: example.com
  format: pem
  expiryOffset: 1s
  ttl: 60s
  namespace: tenant-1
  destination:
    create: true
    name: pki1
```

### VaultDynamicSecret Custom Resource

Provides the configuration necessary for the Operator to synchronize a single Vault *dynamic* Secret to a single Kubernetes Secret.<br />
Supported secrets engines *non-exhaustive*: [databases](/vault/docs/secrets/databases), [aws](/vault/docs/secrets/aws),
[azure](/vault/docs/secrets/azure), [gcp](/vault/docs/secrets/gcp), ...

```yaml
---
apiVersion: secrets.hashicorp.com/v1alpha1
kind: VaultDynamicSecret
metadata:
  namespace: vso-example
  name: example
spec:
  vaultAuthRef: example
  mount: db
  role: postgres
  destination:
    create: true
    name: dynamic1
```
