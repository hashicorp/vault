# Upgrade the Vault EKM provider

~> **Note:** The upgrade process will put the database into maintenance mode and
    require a restart. It is highly recommended to test this procedure in a
    staging environment prior to running it on a production database.

1. Disable the Vault EKM Provider, and verify it is marked disabled:

    ```sql
    ALTER CRYPTOGRAPHIC PROVIDER TransitVaultProvider DISABLE;
    SELECT * FROM sys.cryptographic_providers;
    ```

1. Install the latest version from [releases.hashicorp.com][releases], following
  the instructions in the installer.
    1. If you get a "Files in Use" prompt while running the installer, select
      "Do not close applications. A reboot will be required", and restart
      after the installation has completed.
1. Reload the provider DLL:

    ```sql
    ALTER CRYPTOGRAPHIC PROVIDER TransitVaultProvider
        FROM FILE = 'C:\Program Files\HashiCorp\Transit Vault EKM Provider\TransitVaultEKM.dll';
    ```

1. Now re-enable the Vault EKM Provider and verify it is both marked enabled
  and the version reported matches the version of the installer:

    ```sql
    ALTER CRYPTOGRAPHIC PROVIDER TransitVaultProvider ENABLE;
    SELECT * FROM sys.cryptographic_providers;
    ```

1. Finally, restart Microsoft SQL Server.
