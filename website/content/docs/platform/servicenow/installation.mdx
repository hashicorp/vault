# Install Vault ServiceNow Credential Resolver

## Prerequisites

* ServiceNow version Quebec+ (untested on previous versions)
* MID server version Quebec+ (untested on previous versions)
* Discovery and external credential plugins activated on ServiceNow
* Working Vault deployment accessible from the MID server

## Installing Vault agent

* Select your desired auth method from Agent's [supported auth methods](/vault/docs/agent-and-proxy/autoauth/methods)
  and set it up in Vault
  * For example, to set up AppRole auth and a role called `role1` with the `demo` policy attached:

    ```bash
    vault auth enable approle
    vault policy write demo - <<EOF
    path "secret/*" {
      capabilities = ["read"]
    }
    EOF
    vault write auth/approle/role/role1 bind_secret_id=true token_policies=demo
    ```

  * To get the files required for the example Agent config below, you can then
    run:

    ```bash
    echo -n $(vault read -format json auth/approle/role/role1/role-id | jq -r '.data.role_id') > /path/to/roleID
    echo -n $(vault write -format json -f auth/approle/role/role1/secret-id | jq -r '.data.secret_id') > /path/to/secretID
    ```

* Create an `agent.hcl` config file. Your exact configuration may vary, but you
  must set `cache.use_auto_auth_token = true`, and the `listener`, `vault` and
  `auto_auth` blocks are also required to set up a working Agent, e.g.:

  ```hcl
  listener "tcp" {
    address = "127.0.0.1:8200"
    tls_disable = false
    tls_cert_file = "/path/to/cert.pem"
    tls_key_file = "/path/to/key.pem"
  }

  cache {
    use_auto_auth_token = true
  }

  vault {
    address = "http://vault.example.com:8200"
  }

  auto_auth {
      method {
          type = "approle"
          config = {
              role_id_file_path = "/path/to/roleID"
              secret_id_file_path = "/path/to/secretID"
              remove_secret_id_file_after_reading = false
          }
      }
  }
  ```

* Install Vault Agent as a service running `vault agent -config=/path/to/agent.hcl`
  * Documentation for Windows service installation [here](/vault/docs/agent-and-proxy/agent/winsvc)

## Uploading JAR file to MID server

<Warning heading="Use the ServiceNow app store to install Vault Credential Resolver">
  The steps documented below are for **pre ServiceNow UTAH versions**.

  As of ServiceNow version UTAH, use the "HashiCorp Vault Credential Resolver" App 
  from the ServiceNow App store to install the Vault Credential Resolver and verify
  the jar file installed is `vault-servicenow-credential-resolver`. If you wish to
  use a custom name, you must manually rename the deployed jar. 
</Warning>

* Download the latest version of the Vault Credential Resolver JAR file from
  [releases.hashicorp.com](https://releases.hashicorp.com/vault-servicenow-credential-resolver/)
* In ServiceNow, navigate to "MID server - JAR files" -> New
  * Manage Attachments -> upload Vault Credential Resolver JAR
  * Fill in name, version etc as desired
  * Click Submit
* Navigate to "MID server - Properties" -> New
  * Set Name: `mid.external_credentials.vault.address`, Value: Address of Vault
    Agent listener from previous step, e.g. `http://127.0.0.1:8200`
  * **Optional:** Set the property `mid.external_credentials.vault.ca` to the
    trusted CA in PEM format if using TLS between the MID server and Vault
    Agent with a self-signed certificate.

## Next steps

See [configuration](/vault/docs/platform/servicenow/configuration) for details on
configuring the resolver and using credentials for discovery.
