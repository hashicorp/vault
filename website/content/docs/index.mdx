# Documentation

Welcome to the Vault product documentation!

If you are getting started with Vault, we recommend reading the
[What is Vault](/vault/docs/what-is-vault) docs before diving into our
[Vault Foundations tutorial set](/vault/tutorials/getting-started)
or our [Vault operator quickstart guide](/vault/docs/get-started/operations-qs).
