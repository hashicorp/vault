# Feature deprecation notice and plans

This announcement page is maintained and updated periodically to communicate important decisions made concerning End of Support (EoS) for Vault features as well as features we have removed or disabled from the product. We document the removal of features, enable the community with a plan and timeline for eventual deprecations, and supply alternative paths to explore and evaluate to minimize business disruptions. If you have questions or concerns about a deprecated feature, please create a topic on [the community forum](https://discuss.hashicorp.com/c/vault/30) or raise a ticket with your support team. Please refer to the [FAQ](/vault/docs/deprecation/faq) page for frequently asked questions concerning Vault feature deprecations.

**Deprecation Announcement**: This indicates the release version during which the announcement was made to deprecate a feature.

**End of Support**: This indicates when a deprecated feature becomes unsupported. Consult the table below and consider the timeline provided to upgrade. If you use Vault Enterprise and require help with a deprecated feature, the Vault Support Team will provide limited support. However, we will not provide software patches or bug fixes. Refer to the [HashiCorp Support Policy](https://support.hashicorp.com/hc/en-us/articles/360021185113-Support-Period-and-End-of-Life-EOL-Policy) to understand our product support timeline.

**Feature Removal**: This indicates that the feature is completely removed/disabled from the product.

~> **Note**: All specified targeted version announcements for End of Support and Feature Removal may be subject to change.

SSH certificates do not require an external connection from Vault to provision the key/certificate and more secure than having Vault provision dynamic SSH keys.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | [SSH Certificates](/vault/docs/secrets/ssh/signed-ssh-certificates)                                                                                                                                                                               |

Only the [Verified Publisher](https://hub.docker.com/r/hashicorp/vault) `hashicorp/vault` image will be updated on DockerHub. Users of [Official Images](https://hub.docker.com/_/vault) will need to use `docker pull hashicorp/vault:<version>` instead of `docker pull vault:version` to get newer versions of Vault in Docker images.

As Vault updates its Go version to 1.18, you should plan to move off SHA-1 for certficate signing. Operators can set a Go [environmental variable](/vault/docs/deprecation/faq#q-what-is-the-impact-of-removing-support-for-x-509-certificates-with-signatures-that-use-sha-1) to restore SHA-1 support if they need to continue using SHA-1. It is unknown at this time when Go will remove the environmental variable support. Therefore, we highly encourage you to migrate off of SHA-1 for certificate signing. | [FAQ](/vault/docs/deprecation/faq#q-what-is-the-impact-of-removing-support-for-x-509-certificates-with-signatures-that-use-sha-1)                                                                                                                 |

*If you use **Standalone DB Engines** or **AppID (Community)**, you should actively plan to migrate away from their usage. If you use these features and upgrade to Release 1.12, Vault will log error messages and shut down, and any attempts to add new mounts will result in an error.
This behavior may temporarily be overridden when starting the Vault server by using the `VAULT_ALLOW_PENDING_REMOVAL_MOUNTS` environment variable until they are officially removed in Vault version 1.13.
If you are still using these deprecated features and attempt to upgrade to 1.13 (the target feature removal timeframe), you will not be able to start up Vault without downgrading and migrating away from these features.
