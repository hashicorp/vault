# Azure secret import source

Use the Azure source to import secret data from Azure KeyVault into your Vault instance.

## Argument reference

Refer to the [HCL syntax](/vault/docs/import#hcl-syntax-1) for arguments common to all source types.

## Additional arguments

Required:

- `key_vault_uri` `(string)` - The URI of the Azure KeyVault you want to import from.

All the following are optional, in which case the default provider mechanisms are used, e.g.
a preliminary `az login` can suffice.

- `cloud_name` `(string: "AzureCloud")` - Azure cloud to connect to
- `tenant_id` `(string: "")` - Tenant ID to use
- `client_id` `(string: "")` - Client ID to use
- `credentials_file` `(string: "")` - Path to a file with the client secret

## Example

Define and configure the `my-azure-source-1` Azure source:

```hcl
source_aws {
  name = "my-azure-source-1"
  key_vault_uri = "https://keyvault-1234abcd.vault.azure.net"
}
```

## Permissions

To use Azure import, you must grant the associated Azure identity permission to read secrets
from the specified KeyVault:

```shell-session
"Get",
"List",
```
