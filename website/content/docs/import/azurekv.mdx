# Azure secret import source


<Note>
All secrets including expired ones will imported from the provided Azure Key Vault URI
</Note>

## Argument reference

Refer to the [HCL syntax](/vault/docs/import#hcl-syntax-1) for arguments common to all source types.

## Additional arguments

- `key_vault_uri` `(string: <required>)` - The URI of the Azure Key Vault you want to import from.

The following parameters are optional. If you leave these parameters unset,
Vault uses the default credential provider mechanisms, e.g. the credentials persisted to disk
by a preceding `az login`.

- `cloud_name` `(string: "AzureCloud")` - Azure cloud to connect to
- `tenant_id` `(string: "")` - Tenant ID to use
- `client_id` `(string: "")` - Client ID to use
- `credentials_file` `(string: "")` - Path to a file with the client secret

- `vault_mount_path` `(string: "")` - The Vault mount path to a pre-configured Azure
  secrets engine used to generate dynamic credentials for the importer.

- `vault_role_name` `(string: "")` - The Vault role used to generate a dynamic
  credential for the importer. The role name must exist in the pre-configured Azure secrets
  engine mount.

- `vault_namespace` `(string: "")` - The Vault namespace containing the pre-configured Azure secrets engine
  mount path specified in `vault_mount_path` for use with dynamic secrets.

- `vault_address` `(string: "")` - The address of the Vault server to use for dynamic credentials. 

- `vault_credentials_file` `(string: "")` - The path to a file containing a Vault token for the vault server configured above.


## Step 1: Set Azure Identity Permissions

To use Azure import, you must grant the associated Azure identity permission to read secrets
from the specified Key Vault:

```shell-session
"Get",
"List",
```

## Step 2: Define the Azure source

<Tabs>
<Tab heading="Static credentials">

The following configuration example uses Azure static credentials to
import secrets from Azure Key Vault:

```hcl
source_azure {
  name = "my-azure-source-1"
  key_vault_uri = "https://keyvault-1234abcd.vault.azure.net"
  tenant_id = "<your tenant id>"
  client_id = "<your client id>"
  credentials_file = "/path/to/client-secret"
}
```

 If `tenant_id`, `client_id` and `credentials_file` is set, then `vault_mount_path`, `vault_role_name`,`vault_namespace`,`vault_address` and `vault_credentials_file` must be unset.

</Tab>
<Tab heading="Dynamic credentials">

Alternatively, source credentials can also be derived dynamically using the [Azure Secret Engine](/vault/docs/secrets/azure)

This uses the Azure secrets engine configured at the given `vault_address` to generate dynamic secrets in order to scan secrets in Azure KeyVault.

```hcl
source_azure {
  name             = "my-azure-source-2"
  vault_mount_path = "azure"
  vault_role_name  = "my-azure-role-1"
  vault_namespace  = "ns-1"
  vault_address    = "https://vault.example.com:8200"
  vault_credentials_file = "/path/to/vault/token"
}
```

If one of `vault_mount_path`,`vault_role_name`, `vault_namespace`,`vault_address` or `vault_credentials_file`  are set, then `tenant_id`, `client_id` and `credentials_file`  must be unset.
