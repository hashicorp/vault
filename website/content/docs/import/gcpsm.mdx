# GCP secret import source

Use the GCP source to import secret data from GCP Secret Manager into your Vault instance. To use dynamic
credentials with GCP import, ensure the [GCP secrets engine](/vault/docs/secrets/gcp) is already configured.

## Argument reference

Refer to the [HCL syntax](/vault/docs/import#hcl-syntax-1) for arguments common to all source types.

## Additional arguments

- `credentials_file` `(string: "")` - The path to the service account key credentials file to authenticate with.

- `vault_mount_path` `(string: "")` - The Vault mount path to a pre-configured GCP
  secrets engine used to generate dynamic credentials for the importer.

- `vault_role_name` `(string: "")` - The Vault role used to generate a dynamic
  credential for the importer. The role name must exist in the pre-configured GCP secrets
  engine mount.

- `vault_namespace` `(string: "")` - The Vault namespace containing the preconfigured GCP secrets engine
  mount path specified in `vault_mount_path` for use with dynamic secrets.

- `vault_address` `(string: "")` - The address of the Vault server to use for dynamic credentials. 

- `vault_credentials_file` `(string: "")` - The path to a file containing a Vault token.

<Note>
-  If `credentials_file` is set, then `vault_mount_path`, `vault_role_name`,`vault_namespace`,`vault_address` and `vault_credentials_file` must be unset.
-  If one of `vault_mount_path`,`vault_role_name`, `vault_namespace`,`vault_address` or `vault_credentials_file`  are set, then `credentials` must be unset.
</Note>

## Example

Define and configure the `my-gcp-source-1` GCP source:

```hcl
source_gcp {
  name             = "my-gcp-source-1"
  vault_mount_path = "gcp"
  vault_role_name  = "my-gcp-role-1"
  vault_namespace  = "ns-1"
  vault_address    = "https://vault.example.com:8200"
  vault_credentials_file = "/path/to/vault/token"
}
```

## Permissions

To use GCP import, you must grant the associated GCP identity permission to read secrets:

```shell-session
"secretmanager.secrets.list",
"secretmanager.versions.access",
```
