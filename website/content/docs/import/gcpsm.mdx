# GCP secret import source

Use the GCP source to import secret data from GCP Secret Manager into your Vault instance. To use dynamic
credentials with GCP import, ensure the [GCP secrets engine](/vault/docs/secrets/gcp) is already configured.

## Argument reference

Refer to the [HCL syntax](/vault/docs/import#hcl-syntax-1) for arguments common to all source types.

## Additional arguments

- `credentials_file` `(string: "")` - The path to the service account key credentials file to authenticate with.

## Example

Define and configure the `my-gcp-source-1` GCP source:

```hcl
source_gcp {
  name             = "my-gcp-source-1"
  credentials_file = "path/to/credentials_file"
}
```

## Permissions

To use GCP import, you must grant the associated GCP identity permission to read secrets:

```shell-session
"secretmanager.secrets.list",
"secretmanager.versions.access",
```
