# Secrets import

@include 'alerts/enterprise-only.mdx'

@include 'alerts/experimental.mdx'

Distributing sensitive information across multiple external systems creates
several challenges, including:

- Increased operational overhead.
- Increased exposure risk from data sprawl.
- Increased risk of outdated and out-of-sync information.

Using Vault as a single source of truth (SSOT) for sensitive data increases
security and reduces management overhead, but migrating preexisting data from multiple
and/or varied sources can be complex and costly. 

The secrets import process helps you automate and streamline your sensitive data
migration with codified import plans as HCL files. Import plans tell Vault which KVv2 secrets
engine instance to store the expected secret data in, the source system for which data will be
read from, and how to filter this data. Three HCL blocks make this possible:

- The `destination` block defines target KVv2 mounts.
- The `source` block provides credentials for connecting to the external system.
- The `mapping` block defines how Vault should decide which data gets imported before
  writing the information to KVv2.

## Destinations

Vault stores imported secrets in a Vault KVv2 secrets engine mount. Destination
blocks start with `destination_vault` and define the desired KVv2 mount path and
an optional namespace. The combination of these represent the exact location in your
Vault instance you want the information stored.

### HCL syntax


```hcl
destination_vault {
  name      = "my-dest-1"
  namespace = "ns-1"
  mount     = "mount-1"
}
```

- `name` `(string: <required>)` - A unique name for the destination block that can
  be referenced in subsequent mapping blocks.

- `mount` `(string: <required>)` - The mount path for the target KVv2 instance.

- `address` `(string)` - Optional network address of the Vault server with the
  KVv2 secrets engine enabled. By default, the Vault client's address will be used.

- `token` `(string)` - Optional authentication token for the Vault server at the
  specified address. By default, the Vault client's token will be used.

- `namespace` `(string)` - Optional namespace path containing the specified KVv2
  mount. By default, Vault looks for the KVv2 mount under the root namespace.



## Sources

Vault can import secrets from the following sources:
- [GCP Secret Manager](/vault/docs/import/gcpsm)

To pull data from a source during import, Vault needs read credentials for the
external system. You can provide credentials directly as part of the import
plan, or use Vault to automatically generate dynamic credentials if you already
have the corresponding secrets engine configured.

### HCL syntax

Source blocks start with `source_<external_system>` and include any connection
information required by the target system or the secrets engine to leverage. For example:

```hcl
source_gcp {
  name        = "my-gcp-source-1"
  credentials = "@/path/to/service-account-key.json"
}
```

- `name` `(string: <required>)` - A unique name for the source block that can be
  referenced in subsequent mapping blocks.

- `credentials` `(string: <required>)` - Path to a credential file or token with
  read permissions for the target system.

Depending on the source system, additional information may be required. Refer to
the connection documentation for your source system to determine the full set of
required fields for that system type.



## Mappings

Mappings glue the source and destination together and filter the migrated data,
to determine what is imported and what is ignored. Vault currently supports the
following mapping methods:

- [mapping_passthrough](/vault/docs/import/mappings#passthrough)
- [mapping_metadata](/vault/docs/import/mappings#metadata)
- [mapping_regex](/vault/docs/import/mappings#regex)

### HCL syntax

Mapping blocks start with `mapping_<filter_type>` and require a source name,
destination name, an execution priority, and any corresponding transformations
or filters that apply for each mapping type. For example:

```hcl
mapping_regex {
  name        = "my-map-1"
  source      = "my-gcp-source-1"
  destination = "my-dest-1"
  priority    = 1
  expression  = "^database/.*$"
}
```

- `name` `(string: <required>)` - A unique name for the mapping block.

- `source` `(string: <required>)` - The name of a previously-defined source block
  **from** which the data should be read.

- `destination` `(string: <required>)` - The name of a previously defined
  destination block **to** which the data should be written.

- `priority` `(integer: <required>)` - The order in which Vault should apply the
  mapping block during the import process. The lower the number, the higher the
  priority. For example, a mapping with priority 1 executes before a mapping
  with priority 2.

Depending on the filter type, additional fields may be required or possible. Refer
to the [import mappings documentation](/vault/docs/import/mappings) for the available
supported options and for a list of each mapping's specific fields.

<Tip title="Priority matters">

  Vault applies mapping definitions in priority order and a given secret only
  matches to the first mapping that applies. Once Vault imports a secret with a
  particular mapping, subsequent reads from the same source will ignore that
  secret. See the [priority section](/vault/docs/import/mappings#priority) for an example.
