# AWS secret import source

Use the AWS importer to read secret data from AWS Secret Manager into your Vault
instance.

## Before you start
- **You must know the relevant AWS credentials**. You can provide the credentials
  as environment variables, as explicit arguments, or use dynamic credentials
  from an existing [AWS secrets plugin](/vault/docs/secrets/aws) mount path.

## Step 1: Set AWS Identity permissions
To use AWS import, you must grant the associated AWS identity permission to read
the relevant secrets:

```shell-session
"secretsmanager:DescribeSecret",
"secretsmanager:GetSecretValue",
"secretsmanager:BatchGetSecretValue",
"secretsmanager:ListSecrets",
```
## Step 2: Define the AWS source

<Tabs>
<Tab heading="Static credentials">

The following configuration example uses static credentials in a AWS profile to
import secrets from AWS:

```hcl  
source_aws {
  name = "my-aws-source-1"
  credentials_profile = "my-cred-profile-name"
}
```

If you provide a static credential profile you must leave `vault_mount_path`, 
`vault_role_name`, `vault_namespace`, `vault_address`, and
`vault_credentials_file` unset. If set one of the dynamic credential parameters,
Vault returns an error.
</Tab>
<Tab heading="Dynamic credentials">

Alternatively, source credentials can also be derived dynamically using the [AWS Secret Engine](/vault/docs/secrets/aws#sts-session-tokens)

The following configuration example uses dynamic credentials stored in the
AWS secrets engine configured at `vault_address` to import secrets from AWS.

```hcl
source_aws {
  name = "my-aws-source-2"
  vault_mount_path = "aws"
  vault_role_name  = "temp_user"
  vault_namespace  = "ns-1"
  vault_address    = "${VAULT_ADDR}$"
  vault_credentials_file = "/path/to/vault/token"
}
```
You must provide values for `vault_mount_path`, `vault_role_name`,
`vault_namespace`, `vault_address`, and `vault_credentials_file` to use dynamic
credentials. If you leave one of the required arguments unset, or try to set
`credentials_profile`, Vault returns an error.

## Argument reference

Refer to the [HCL syntax](/vault/docs/import#hcl-syntax-1) for arguments common to all source types.

- `vault_mount_path` `(string: "")` - The Vault mount path to a pre-configured AWS
  secrets engine used to generate dynamic credentials for the importer.

- `vault_role_name` `(string: "")` - AWS secrets plugin role used to generate
  dynamic credentials for the importer. Only required for dynamic credentials.

- `vault_namespace` `(string: "")` - Vault namespace for the mount path
  specified in `vault_mount_path`. Only required for dynamic credentials.

- `vault_address` `(string: "")` - Local path to a file containing a
  valid token for the Vault server at `vault_address`. Only required for dynamic
  credentials.

- `vault_credentials_file` `(string: "")` - The path to a file containing a Vault token for the vault server configured above.

- `credentials_profile` `(string: "")` - The name of the profile in your credentials file to authenticate with.
  If not set, Vault uses the default credential provider mechanisms.
