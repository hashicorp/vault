# Vault secret import source

Use the Vault source to import secret data from a Vault cluster into your Vault instance.

## Argument reference

Refer to the [HCL syntax](/vault/docs/import#hcl-syntax-1) for arguments common to all source types.

## Additional arguments

- `address` `(string: required)` - API address of source vault cluster.
- `namespace` `(string: "")` - Optional namespace to read from.
- `mount` `(string: required)` - KV-v2 mount to read from.
- `credentials_file` `(string: "")` - Path to a file containing a vault token.  Note that the environment
variable VAULT_TOKEN can't normally be used for this, since the CLI will use VAULT_TOKEN to authenticate to
the destination Vault.  Exception: it's possible to import from/to the same Vault cluster.

## Example

Define and configure the `my-vault-source-1` Vault source:

```hcl
source_vault {
  name = "my-vault-source-1"
  address = "https://source-vault-address:8200"
  namespace = "ns1"
  mount = "my-kvv2"
  credentials_file = "/path/to/vault/token"
}
```
