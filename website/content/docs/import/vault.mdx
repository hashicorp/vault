# Vault secret import source

Use the Vault source to import secret data from a Vault cluster into your Vault instance.

## Argument reference

Refer to the [HCL syntax](/vault/docs/import#hcl-syntax-1) for arguments common to all source types.

## Additional arguments

- `address` `(string: required)` - API address of source vault cluster.
- `namespace` `(string: "")` - Optional namespace to read from.
- `mount` `(string: required)` - KV-v2 mount to read from.
- `credentials_file` `(string: "")` - Path to a file containing a vault token.  If absent, the CLI uses the
environment variable VAULT_TOKEN.  However, VAULT_TOKEN will be used for the Vault destination as well, so
unless you're using the same cluster as both source and destination (e.g. from one mount to another), the source
`credentials_file` should be populated with the source-specific token.

## Example

Define and configure the `my-vault-source-1` Vault source:

```hcl
source_vault {
  name = "my-vault-source-1"
  address = "https://source-vault-address:8200"
  namespace = "ns1"
  mount = "my-kvv2"
  credentials_file = "/path/to/vault/token"
}
```
