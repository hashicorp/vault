# Installing Vault

There are several options to install Vault:

1. Install from a [Package Manager](#package-manager).

1. Use a [precompiled binary](#precompiled-binaries).

1. Install [from source](#compiling-from-source).

1. [Helm for Kubernetes](/vault/docs/platform/k8s/helm)


## Package Manager

HashiCorp manages packages for Ubuntu, Debian, Fedora, RHEL, Amazon
Linux, and other distributions. Follow the instructions at [HashiCorp
Tutorials][learn-vault-install] to add our PGP key, add a repository, and
install.

## Precompiled Binaries

To install the precompiled binary, [download](/vault/downloads) the applicable
package for your system. Vault is packaged as a zip file.

Once the zip is downloaded, unzip the file into your designated directory. The `vault` binary
inside is all that is necessary to run Vault (or `vault.exe` for Windows). No
additional files are required to run Vault.

Copy the binary to your system. If you intend to access it from the
command-line, ensure that you place the binary somewhere on your `PATH`.

Refer to the [HashiCorp Tutorials][learn-vault-dev-server] to start a server, `put`
your first secret, and use other features of Vault.

## Compiling from Source

To compile from source, you will need [Go](https://golang.org) installed and
properly configured (including a `GOPATH` environment variable set), as well as
a copy of [`git`](https://www.git-scm.com/) in your `PATH`.

Clone the Vault repository from GitHub into your `GOPATH`:

```shell
$ mkdir -p $GOPATH/src/github.com/hashicorp && cd $_
$ git clone https://github.com/hashicorp/vault.git
$ cd vault
```

Bootstrap the project. This will download and compile libraries and tools needed
to compile Vault:

```shell
$ make bootstrap
```

Build Vault for your current system and put the binary in `./bin/` (relative to
the git checkout). The `make dev` target is just a shortcut that builds `vault`
for only your local build environment (no cross-compiled targets).

```shell
$ make dev
```

## Verifying the Installation

To verify Vault is installed, run `vault -h` on your system. You should
see the help output. If you are executing it from the command line, ensure it is
on your `PATH` to avoid receiving an error that Vault is not found.

```shell-session
$ vault -h
```
