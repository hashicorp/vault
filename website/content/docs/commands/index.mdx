# Vault CLI

The Vault CLI is a static binary that wraps the Vault API. While every CLI
command maps directly to one or more APIs internally, not every endpoint is
exposed publicly and not every API endpoint has a corresponding CLI command.



## Usage 

<CodeBlockConfig hideClipboard>

```shell-session
$ vault <command> [subcommand(s)] [flag(s)] [command-argument(s)]

$ vault <command> [subcommand(s)] [-help | -h]
```

</CodeBlockConfig>

<Tip>

  Use the `-help` flag with any command to see a description of the command and a
  list of supported options and flags.

</Tip>

The Vault CLI returns different exit codes depending on whether and where an
error occurred:

- **`0`** - Success
- **`1`** - Local/terminal error (invalid flags, failed validation, wrong
  numbers of arguments, etc.)
- **`2`** - Remote/server error (API failures, bad TLS, incorrect API
  parameters, etc.)


### Authenticating to Vault

Unauthenticated users can use CLI commands with the `--help` flag, but must use
[`vault login`](/vault/docs/commands/login) or set the
[`VAULT_TOKEN`](/vault/docs/commands#standard-vault_token) environment variable
to use the CLI.

The CLI uses a token helper to cache access tokens after authenticating with
`vault login` The default file for cached tokens is `~/.vault-token` and
deleting the file forcibly logs the user out of Vault.

If you prefer to use a custom token helper,
[you can create your own](/vault/docs/commands/token-helper) and configure the
CLI to use it.


### Passing command arguments

Command arguments include any relevant configuration settings and
command-specific options. Command options pass input data as `key=value` pairs,
which you can provided inline, as a `stdin` stream, or from a local file.

<Tabs>

<Tab heading="Inline">

To pass input inline with the command, use the `<option-name>=<value>` syntax:

<CodeBlockConfig hideClipboard>

```shell-session
$ vault audit enable file file_path="/var/log/vault.log"
```

</CodeBlockConfig>

</Tab>

<Tab heading="stdin">

To pass input from `stdin`, use `-` as a stand-in for the entire `key=value`
pair or a specific option value.

To pipe the option and value, use a JSON object with the option name and value:

<CodeBlockConfig hideClipboard>

```shell-session
$ echo -n '{"file_path":"/var/log/vault.log"}' | vault audit enable file -
```

</CodeBlockConfig>

To pipe the option value by itself, provide the option name inline:

<CodeBlockConfig hideClipboard>

```shell-session
$ echo -n "/var/log/vault.log" | vault audit enable file file_path=-
```

</CodeBlockConfig>

</Tab>

<Tab heading="Local file">

To pass data as a file, use `@` as a stand-in for the entire
`<option-name>=<value>` pair or a specific option value.

To pass the option and value, use a JSON file:

<CodeBlockConfig hideClipboard>

```shell-session
data.json:
{
  "file_path":"/var/log/vault.log"
}

$ vault audit enable file @data.json
```

</CodeBlockConfig>

To pass the option value by itself, use the option name inline and pass the
value as text:

<CodeBlockConfig hideClipboard>

```shell-session
data.txt:
/var/log/vault.log

$ vault audit enable file file_path=@data.txt
```

</CodeBlockConfig>

If you use `@` as part of an argument **name** in `<option-name>=<value>`
format, Vault treats the `@` as part of the key name, rather than a file
reference. As a result, Vault does not support filenames that include the `=`
character.

<Note title="Escape literal '@' values">

  To keep Vault from parsing values that begin with a literal `@`, escape the
  value with a backslash (`\`):

<CodeBlockConfig hideClipboard>

```shell-session
$ vault login -method userpass  \
    username="mitchellh"        \
    password="\@badpasswordisbad"
```

</CodeBlockConfig>

</Note>

</Tab>

</Tabs>


### Calling API endpoints 

To invoke an API endpoint with the Vault CLI, you can use one of the following
CLI commands with the associated endpoint path:

CLI command    | HTTP verbs
-------------- | -------------
`vault read`   | `GET`
`vault write`  | `PUT`, `POST`
`vault delete` | `DELETE`
`vault list`   | `LIST`

For example, to call the UpsertLDAPGroup endpoint,
`/auth/ldap/groups/{group-name}` to create a new LDAP group called `admin`:

<CodeBlockConfig hideClipboard>

```shell-session
$ vault write /auth/ldap/groups/admin policies="admin,default"
```

</CodeBlockConfig>

<Tip title="Core plugins have dedicated commands">

  You can use `read`, `write`, `delete`, or `list` with the relevant paths for
  any valid API endpoint, but some plugins are central to the functionality
  of Vault and have dedicated CLI commands:

  - [`vault kv`](/vault/docs/commands/kv)
  - [`vault transit`](/vault/docs/commands/transit)
  - [`vault transform`](/vault/docs/commands/transform)
  - [`vault token`](/vault/docs/commands/token)

</Tip>



## Enable autocomplete

The CLI does not autocomplete commands by default. To enable autocomplete for
flags, subcommands, and arguments (where supported), use the
`-autocomplete-install` flag and **restart your shell session**:

```shell-session
$ vault -autocomplete-install
```

To use autocomplete, press `<tab>` while typing a command to show a list of
available completions. Or, use the `-<tab>` flag to show available flag
completions for the current command.

<Tip>

  If you have configured the `VAULT_*` environment variables needed to connect to
  your Vault instance, the autocomplete feature automatically queries the Vault
  server and returns helpful argument suggestions.

</Tip>



## Configure environment variables

You can use environment variables to configure the CLI globally. Some
configuration settings have a corresponding CLI flag to configure a specific
command.

For example, `export VAULT_ADDR='http://localhost:8200'` sets the
address of your Vault server globally, while
`-address='http://someotherhost:8200'` overrides the value for a specific
command.

## Troubleshoot CLI errors

If you run into errors when executing a particular CLI command, the following
flags and commands can help you track down the problem.


### Confirm you are using the right endpoint or command

If a command behaves differently than expected or you need details about a
specific endpoint, you can use the
[`vault path-help`](/vault/docs/commands/path-help) command to see the help text
for a given endpoint path.

For example, to see the help for `sys/mounts`:

```shell-session
$ vault path-help sys/mounts
Request:        mounts
Matching Route: ^mounts$

List the currently mounted backends.

## DESCRIPTION

This path responds to the following HTTP methods.

    GET /
        Lists all the mounted secret backends.

    GET /<mount point>
        Get information about the mount at the specified path.

    POST /<mount point>
        Mount a new secret backend to the mount point in the URL.

    POST /<mount point>/tune
        Tune configuration parameters for the given mount point.

    DELETE /<mount point>
        Unmount the specified mount point.
```

### Construct the associated cURL command

To determine if the problem exists with the structure of your CLI command or the
associated endpoint, you can use the `-output-curl-string` flag:

For example, to test that a `vault write` command to create a new user is not
failing due to an issue with the `/auth/userpass/users/{username}` endpoint, use
the generated cURL command to call the endpoint directly:

```shell-session
$ vault write -output-curl-string  auth/userpass/users/bob password="long-password"

curl -X PUT -H "X-Vault-Request: true" -H "X-Vault-Token: $(vault print token)" -d '{"password":"long-password"}' http://127.0.0.1:8200/v1/auth/userpass/users/bob
```

### Construct the required Vault policy

To determine if the problem relates to insufficient permissions, you can use the
`-output-policy` flag to construct a minimal Vault policy that grants the
permissions needed to execute the relevant command.

For example, to confirm you have permission to write a secret to the `kv`
plugin, mounted at `kv/secret`, use `-output-policy` then confirm you have the
capabilities listed:

```
$ vault kv put -output-policy kv/secret value=itsasecret

path "kv/data/secret" {
  capabilities = ["create", "update"]
}
```
