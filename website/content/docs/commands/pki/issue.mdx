# pki issue

Issues a new intermediate ("issuer") certificate using a parent certificate in Vault.

<CodeBlockConfig hideClipboard>

```shell-session
$ vault pki issue [flags] <parent> <child_mount> [options]

$ vault pki issue [-help | -h]
```

</CodeBlockConfig>

## Description

`pki issue` creates a intermediate certificate authority certificate signed by
the `parent` in the `child_mount` using the options to determine the fields
on that certificate.

<Tip title="Related API endpoints">

The Vault user running this command needs to have access to the following API 
endpoints, each representing a step in the process:

TODO: These links don't map to any API docs. Usually they're `/pki/issuer/...`

- `READ /:parent` - used to check validity
- `WRITE /:child_mount/intermediate/generate/:type` - used to generate the csr
- `WRITE /:parent/sign-intermediate` - used to sign the csr
- `WRITE /:child_mount/issuers/import/cert` - used to import the new issuer,
and the issuer chain
- `UPDATE /:child_mount/issuer/:issuer_refs` - used to both name the new
issuer, and also set the name of the parent in the issuer chain
- `READ /:child_mount/issuer/:new_issuer_ref` - used to verify completion,
generate the output
