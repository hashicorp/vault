## Description

`pki verify-sign` verifies whether the listed issuer has signed the listed issued
certificate..

`issuer` and `issued` are the fully name-spaced path to an issuer certificate.

### Output format

This command returns five fields of information:

1. `signature_match`: indicates whether the issuer's key was used to sign the
issued certificate.

1. `path_match`: indicates whether the issuer certificate exists in the valid
certificate chain of the issued certificate.

1. `key_id_match`: indicates whether the [`key id`](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5280#section-4.2.1.1)
  of the issuer match the `key_id` of the issued.

1. `subject_match`: indicates whether the subject name of the issuer matches the
	issuer subject field of the issued certificate.

1. `trust_match`: indicates whether trusting the parent issuer would be sufficient
  to establish trust in the child certificate through the provided chain.
