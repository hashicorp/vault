## Description

`pki reissue` reissues CA certificates using an existing issuer certificate in 
Vault as a template and lets you customize specific attributes as needed.

<Tip title="Related API endpoints">

The Vault user running this command needs to have access to the following API 
endpoints, each representing a step in the process:

TODO: These links don't map to any API docs. Usually they're `/pki/issuer/...`

- `READ /:parent` - used to check validity
- `READ /:template` - used to generate the options for the new certificate
- `WRITE /:child_mount/intermediate/generate/:type` - used to generate the csr
- `WRITE /:parent/sign-intermediate` - used to sign the csr
- `WRITE /:child_mount/issuers/import/cert` - used to import the new issuer,
  and the issuer chain
- `UPDATE /:child_mount/issuer/:issuer_refs` - used to both name the new
 issuer, and also set the name of the parent in the issuer chain
- `READ /:child_mount/issuer/:new_issuer_ref` - used to verify completion,
 generate the output
