# patch

The `patch` command updates data in Vault at the given path (wrapper command for
HTTP PATCH using the [JSON Patch format](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6902)).
The data can be credentials, secrets, configuration, or arbitrary data. The specific
behavior of the `patch` command is determined at the thing mounted at the path.

Data is specified as "**key=value**" pairs on the command line. If the value begins
with an "**@**", then it is loaded from a file. If the value for a key is "**-**", Vault
will read the value from stdin rather than the command line.

Some API fields require more advanced structures such as maps. These cannot
directly be represented on the command line. However, direct control of the
request parameters can be achieved by using `-` as the only data argument.
This causes `vault patch` to read a JSON blob containing all request parameters
from stdin. This argument will be ignored if used in conjunction with any
"key=value" pairs.

For a full list of examples and paths, please see the documentation that
corresponds to the secrets engines in use.

Unlike [the `write` command](/vault/docs/commands/write), the `patch` command only
modifies data specified on the command line.

## Examples

Updates a PKI role to modify a single parameter:

```shell-session
$ vault patch pki/roles/example allow_localhost=false
```

### API versus CLI

Updates a PKI role to modify the `allow_localhost` parameter:

```shell-session
$ vault patch pki/roles/example allow_localhost=false
```

Equivalent cURL command for this operation:

```shell-session
$ tee request_payload.json -<<EOF
{
   "organization": "hashicorp"
}
EOF

$ curl --header "X-Vault-Token: $VAULT_TOKEN" \
    --request PATCH \
    --header 'Content-Type: application/merge-patch+json'
    --data @request_payload.json \
    $VAULT_ADDR/v1/pki/roles/example
```

The `vault patch` command simplifies the API call.

## Usage

The following flags are available in addition to the [standard set of
flags](/vault/docs/commands) included on all commands.

### Output options

- `-field` `(string: "")` - Print only the field with the given name, in the format
  specified in the `-format` directive. The result will not have a trailing
  newline making it ideal for piping to other processes.

- `-format` `(string: "table")` - Print the output in the given format. Valid
  formats are "table", "json", or "yaml". This can also be specified via the
  `VAULT_FORMAT` environment variable.

### Command options

- `-force` `(bool: false)` - Allow the operation to continue with no key=value
  pairs. This allows writing to keys that do not need or expect data. This is
  aliased as `-f`.
