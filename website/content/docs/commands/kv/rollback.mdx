# kv rollback

~> **NOTE:** This is a [KV version 2](/vault/docs/secrets/kv/kv-v2) secrets
engine command, and not available for Version 1.

The `kv rollback` command restores a given previous version to the current
version at the given path. The value is written as a new version; for instance,
if the current version is 5 and the rollback version is 2, the data from version
2 will become version 6. This command makes it easy to restore unintentionally
overwritten data.

## Examples

Restores the version 2 of the data at key "creds":

```shell-session
$ vault kv rollback -mount=secret -version=2 creds
Key              Value
---              -----
created_time     2019-06-06T17:07:19.299831Z
deletion_time    n/a
destroyed        false
version          6
```

## Usage

There are no flags beyond the [standard set of flags](/vault/docs/commands)
included on all commands.

### Output options

- `-format` `(string: "table")` - Print the output in the given format. Valid
  formats are "table", "json", or "yaml". This can also be specified via the
  `VAULT_FORMAT` environment variable.

### Command options

- `-mount` `(string: "")` - Specifies the path where the KV backend is mounted. 
  If specified, the next argument will be interpreted as the secret path. If 
  this flag is not specified, the next argument will be interpreted as the 
  combined mount path and secret path, with /data/ automatically inserted for 
  KV v2 secrets.

- `-version` `(int: 0)` - Specifies the version number that should be made
  current again.
