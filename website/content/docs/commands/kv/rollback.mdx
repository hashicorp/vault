# kv rollback

<Note>

This is a [KV version 2](/vault/docs/secrets/kv/kv-v2) secrets engine command,
and not available for Version 1.

</Note>

Restores a given previous version to the current version at the given path.

<CodeBlockConfig hideClipboard>

```shell-session
$ vault kv rollback [flags] <key>

$ vault kv rollback [-help | -h]
```

</CodeBlockConfig>

`kv rollback` restores a given previous version to the current version at the
given key. The value is written as a new version. For example, if the current
version is 5 and the rollback version is 2, the data from version 2 will become
version 6.

### Exit codes

The Vault CLI follows consistent exit code conventions to indicate different 
types of errors:

- Exit code 1 indicates local errors, such as invalid flags, validation 
  failures, or incorrect number of arguments.

- Exit code 2 indicates remote errors, such as API failures, TLS issues, or 
  invalid API parameters.

Some commands may use different exit codes for specific scenarios. When this 
occurs, the different behavior is clearly documented in the command's 
documentation.
