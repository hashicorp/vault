# kv

The `kv` command groups subcommands for interacting with Vault's key/value
secrets engine (both [KV version 1](/vault/docs/secrets/kv/kv-v1) and [KV
Version 2](/vault/docs/secrets/kv/kv-v2).

## Syntax

Option flags for a given subcommand are provided after the subcommand, but before the arguments.

The path to where the secrets engine is mounted can be indicated with the `-mount` flag, such as `vault kv get -mount=secret creds`.

The deprecated path-like syntax can also be used (e.g. `vault kv get secret/creds`), but this should be avoided
for KV v2, because it is not actually the full API path to the secret 
(secret/data/foo) and may cause confusion.

~> A `flag provided but not defined: -mount` error means you are using an older version of Vault before the 
mount flag syntax was introduced. Upgrade to at least Vault 1.11, or refer to previous versions of the docs 
which only use the old syntax to refer to the mount path.

## Examples

Create or update the key named "creds" in the KV version 2 enabled at "secret"
with the value "passcode=my-long-passcode":

```shell-session
$ vault kv put -mount=secret creds passcode=my-long-passcode
== Secret Path ==
secret/data/creds

======= Metadata =======
Key                Value
---                -----
created_time       2022-06-15T20:14:17.107852Z
custom_metadata    <nil>
deletion_time      n/a
destroyed          false
version            1
```

Read this value back:

```shell-session
$ vault kv get -mount=secret creds
== Secret Path ==
secret/data/creds

======= Metadata =======
Key                Value
---                -----
created_time       2022-06-15T20:14:17.107852Z
custom_metadata    <nil>
deletion_time      n/a
destroyed          false
version            1

====== Data ======
Key         Value
---         -----
passcode    my-long-passcode
```

Get metadata for the key named "creds":

```shell-session
$ vault kv metadata get -mount=secret creds
=== Metadata Path ===
secret/metadata/creds

========== Metadata ==========
Key                     Value
---                     -----
cas_required            false
created_time            2022-06-15T20:14:17.107852Z
current_version         1
custom_metadata         <nil>
delete_version_after    0s
max_versions            0
oldest_version          0
updated_time            2022-06-15T20:14:17.107852Z

====== Version 1 ======
Key              Value
---              -----
created_time     2022-06-15T20:14:17.107852Z
deletion_time    n/a
destroyed        false
```

Get a specific version of the key named "creds":

```shell-session
$ vault kv get -mount=secret -version=1 creds
== Secret Path ==
secret/data/creds

======= Metadata =======
Key                Value

custom_metadata    <nil>
deletion_time      n/a
destroyed          false
version            1
