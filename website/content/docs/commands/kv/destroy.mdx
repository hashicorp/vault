# kv destroy

~> **NOTE:** This is a [KV version 2](/vault/docs/secrets/kv/kv-v2) secrets
engine command, and not available for Version 1.

The `kv destroy` command permanently removes the specified versions' data
from the key/value secrets engine. If no key exists at the path, no action is
taken.

## Examples

Destroy version 11 of the key "creds":

```shell-session
$ vault kv destroy -mount=secret -versions=11 creds
Success! Data written to: secret/destroy/creds
```

## Usage

There are no flags beyond the [standard set of flags](/vault/docs/commands)
included on all commands.

### Output options

- `-format` `(string: "table")` - Print the output in the given format. Valid
  formats are "table", "json", or "yaml". This can also be specified via the
  `VAULT_FORMAT` environment variable.

### Command options

- `-mount` `(string: "")` - Specifies the path where the KV backend is mounted. 
  If specified, the next argument will be interpreted as the secret path. If 
  this flag is not specified, the next argument will be interpreted as the 
  combined mount path and secret path, with /data/ automatically inserted for 
  KV v2 secrets.

- `-versions` `([]int: <required>)` - The versions to destroy. Their data will
  be permanently deleted.
