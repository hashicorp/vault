# kv put

The `kv put` command writes the data to the given path in the KV secrets
engine.

If working with KV v2, this command creates a new version of a secret at the
specified location. If working with KV v1, this command stores the given secret
at the specified location.

Regardless of the KV version, if the value does not yet exist at the specified
path, the calling token must have an ACL policy granting the "create"
capability. If the value already exists, the calling token must have an ACL
policy granting the "update" capability.

## Examples

Writes the data to the key "creds":

```shell-session
$ vault kv put -mount=secret creds passcode=my-long-passcode
```

The data can also be consumed from a file on disk by prefixing with the "@"
symbol. For example:

```shell-session
$ vault kv put -mount=secret foo @data.json
```

Or it can be read from stdin using the "-" symbol:

```shell-session
$ echo "abcd1234" | vault kv put -mount=secret foo bar=-
```

## Usage

There are no flags beyond the [standard set of flags](/vault/docs/commands)
included on all commands.

### Output options

- `-field` `(string: "")` - Print only the field with the given name. Specifying
  this option will take precedence over other formatting directives. The result
  will not have a trailing newline making it ideal for piping to other
  processes.

- `-format` `(string: "table")` - Print the output in the given format. Valid
  formats are "table", "json", or "yaml". This can also be specified via the
  `VAULT_FORMAT` environment variable.

### Command options

- `-cas` `(int: 0)` - Specifies to use a Check-And-Set operation. If not set the
  write will be allowed. In order for a write to be successful, `cas` must be set to 
  the current version of the secret. If set to 0 a write will only be allowed if 
  the key doesnâ€™t exist as unset keys do not have any version information. Also 
  remember that soft deletes do not remove any underlying version data from storage.
  In order to write to a soft deleted key, the cas parameter must match the key's 
  current version. The default is -1.

- `-mount` `(string: "")` - Specifies the path where the KV backend is mounted. 
  If specified, the next argument will be interpreted as the secret path. If 
  this flag is not specified, the next argument will be interpreted as the 
  combined mount path and secret path, with /data/ automatically inserted for 
  KV v2 secrets.
