# kv put

Writes data to the given path in the KV secrets engine.

<CodeBlockConfig hideClipboard>

```shell-session
$ vault kv put [flags] <key> [data]

$ vault kv put [-help | -h]
```

</CodeBlockConfig>

`kv put` writes the data to the given path in the KV secrets engine.

If you are using KV v1, this command stores the given secret at the specified
location. If you are using KV v2, this command creates a new version of a secret
at the specified location.

Regardless of the KV version, if the value does not yet exist at the specified
path, the calling token must have an ACL policy granting the `create`
capability. If the value already exists, the calling token must have an ACL
policy granting the `update` capability.

- CreateUpdateSecret (v1) - [`POST: /secret/:path`](/vault/api-docs/secret/kv/kv-v1#create-update-secret)
- CreateUpdateSecret (v2) - [`POST: /:secret-mount-path/data/:path`](/vault/api-docs/secret/kv/kv-v2#create-update-secret)

### Exit codes

The Vault CLI follows consistent exit code conventions to indicate different 
types of errors:

- Exit code 1 indicates local errors, such as invalid flags, validation 
  failures, or incorrect number of arguments.

- Exit code 2 indicates remote errors, such as API failures, TLS issues, or 
  invalid API parameters.

Some commands may use different exit codes for specific scenarios. When this 
occurs, the different behavior is clearly documented in the command's 
documentation.

## Command arguments

<br />

@include 'cli/kv/args/key.mdx'

## Command options

After the required `key` argument, you can specify data as additional options in 
`key=value` format. If the value begins with an `@`, Vault will load the value 
from a file. If the value for a key is `-`, Vault will read the value from 
stdin rather than the command line.

Examples: `bar=baz`, `@data.json`, `bar=-`

## Command flags

<br />

@include 'cli/shared/flags/field.mdx'

<br /><hr /><br />

@include 'cli/kv/flags/cas.mdx'

<br /><hr /><br />

@include 'cli/kv/flags/mount.mdx'

## Global flags

<br />

@include 'cli/standard-settings/all-standard-flags.mdx'

## Examples

Writes the data to the key `creds`:

```shell-session
$ vault kv put -mount=secret creds passcode=my-long-passcode
```

Pass the data from a file on disk by prefixing with the "@" symbol:

```shell-session
$ vault kv put -mount=secret foo @data.json
```

Pass the data using stdin by prefixing with the "-" symbol:

```shell-session
$ echo "abcd1234" | vault kv put -mount=secret foo bar=-
```
