# kv delete

Delete the data for the provided path in the key/value secrets engine.

<CodeBlockConfig hideClipboard>

```shell-session
$ vault kv delete [flags] <path>

$ vault kv delete [-help | -h]
```

</CodeBlockConfig>

## Description

`kv delete` deletes the data for the provided path in the key/value secrets
engine. If you are using KV version 2, its versioned data will not be fully
removed, but marked as deleted and will no longer be returned in normal get
requests.

### Exit codes

The Vault CLI follows consistent exit code conventions to indicate different 
types of errors:

- Exit code 1 indicates local errors, such as invalid flags, validation 
  failures, or incorrect number of arguments.

- Exit code 2 indicates remote errors, such as API failures, TLS issues, or 
  invalid API parameters.

Some commands may use different exit codes for specific scenarios. When this 
occurs, the different behavior is clearly documented in the command's 
documentation.
