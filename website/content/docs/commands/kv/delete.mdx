# kv delete

The `kv delete` command deletes the data for the provided path in
the key/value secrets engine. If using KV version 2, its versioned data will
not be fully removed, but marked as deleted and will no longer be returned in
normal get requests.

## Examples

Delete the latest version of the key "creds":

```shell-session
$ vault kv delete -mount=secret creds
Success! Data deleted (if it existed) at: secret/creds
```

**[KV version 2]** Delete version 11 of key "creds":

```shell-session
$ vault kv delete -mount=secret -versions=11 creds
Success! Data deleted (if it existed) at: secret/data/creds
```

## Usage

There are no flags beyond the [standard set of flags](/vault/docs/commands)
included on all commands.

### Command options

- `-mount` `(string: "")` - Specifies the path where the KV backend is mounted.
  If specified, the next argument will be interpreted as the secret path. If
  this flag is not specified, the next argument will be interpreted as the
  combined mount path and secret path, with /data/ automatically inserted for
  KV v2 secrets.

- `-versions` `([]int: <required>)` - The versions to be deleted. The versioned
  data will not be deleted, but it will no longer be returned in normal get
  requests.

~> **NOTE:** The `-versions` command option is only for KV v2.
