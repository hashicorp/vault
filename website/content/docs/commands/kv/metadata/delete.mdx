### Exit codes

The Vault CLI follows consistent exit code conventions to indicate different 
types of errors:

- Exit code 1 indicates local errors, such as invalid flags, validation 
  failures, or incorrect number of arguments.

- Exit code 2 indicates remote errors, such as API failures, TLS issues, or 
  invalid API parameters.

Some commands may use different exit codes for specific scenarios. When this 
occurs, the different behavior is clearly documented in the command's 
documentation.
