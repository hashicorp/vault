# kv get

`kv get` retrieves the value from KV secrets engine at the given key name. If no 
key exists with that name, an error is returned. If a key exists with the name 
but has no data, nothing is returned.

### Exit codes

The Vault CLI follows consistent exit code conventions to indicate different 
types of errors:

- Exit code 1 indicates local errors, such as invalid flags, validation 
  failures, or incorrect number of arguments.

- Exit code 2 indicates remote errors, such as API failures, TLS issues, or 
  invalid API parameters.

Some commands may use different exit codes for specific scenarios. When this 
occurs, the different behavior is clearly documented in the command's 
documentation.

## Examples

Retrieve the data of the key `creds`:

```shell-session
$ vault kv get -mount=secret creds
== Secret Path ==
secret/data/creds

======= Metadata =======
Key                Value
---                -----
created_time       2022-06-15T20:23:40.067093Z
custom_metadata    <nil>
deletion_time      n/a
destroyed          false
version            1

====== Data ======
Key         Value
---         -----
passcode    my-long-passcode
```

If KV version 1 secrets engine is enabled at `secret`, the output has no
metadata since there is no versioning information associated with the data:

```shell-session
$ vault kv get -mount=secret creds
====== Data ======
Key         Value
---         -----
passcode    my-long-passcode
```

Return only the `creds` `passcode` key:

```shell-session
$ vault kv get -mount=secret -field=passcode creds
my-long-passcode
```
