# kv list

The `kv list` command returns a list of key names at the specified location.
Folders are suffixed with /. The input must be a folder; list on a file will not
return a value. Note that no policy-based filtering is performed on keys; do not
encode sensitive information in key names. The values themselves are not
accessible via this command.

Use this command to list all existing key names at a specific path.

## Examples

List values under the key "my-app":

```shell-session
$ vault kv list -mount=secret my-app/
Keys
----
admin_creds
domain
eng_creds
qa_creds
release
```

## Usage

There are no flags beyond the [standard set of flags](/vault/docs/commands)
included on all commands.

### Output options

- `-mount` `(string: "")` - Specifies the path where the KV backend is mounted.
  If specified, the next argument will be interpreted as the secret path. If
  this flag is not specified, the next argument will be interpreted as the
  combined mount path and secret path, with /data/ automatically inserted for
  KV v2 secrets.

- `-format` `(string: "table")` - Print the output in the given format. Valid
  formats are "table", "json", or "yaml". This can also be specified via the
  `VAULT_FORMAT` environment variable.
