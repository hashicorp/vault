# `monitor`

Stream Vault server logs in real-time to `stdout`.

<CodeBlockConfig hideClipboard>

```shell-session
$ vault monitor [flags]

$ vault monitor [-help | -h]
```

</CodeBlockConfig>

## Description

`vault monitor` command shows a real time display of the server logs of a Vault
server. This command accepts a log level as an argument, which can be different
from the log level that the Vault server was started with.

`vault monitor` honors the `VAULT_ADDR` environment variable. The address
specified determines the target server that will be monitored.

### Limitations and warnings

- Note that this command is designed to run indefinitely. It is similar to
  `tail -f` in the Unix world. This command will not exit on its own unless
  it encounters an unexpected error. As a user, you must terminate this
  process yourself to shut it down.

- If Vault is emitting log messages faster than a receiver can process them, the
  some log lines will be dropped.
