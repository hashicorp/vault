# hcp

The `hcp` command groups subcommands for authentication of users or machines to HCP using
either provided arguments or retrieved HCP token through browser login.

A successful authentication results in an HCP token and an HCP Vault address being
locally cached.

The default authentication method is an interactive one, redirecting users to the HCP login browser.
If a non-interactive option is supplied, it can be used if provided with a service principal credential
generated through the HCP portal with the necessary capabilities to access the organization, project, and
HCP Vault cluster chosen.

## Examples

Connect to HCP interactively:

```shell-session
$ vault hcp connect
The default web browser has been opened at <auth_url>. Please continue the login in the web browser.
Success!
```

The following flags are available in addition to the [standard set of
flags](/vault/docs/commands) included on all commands.
