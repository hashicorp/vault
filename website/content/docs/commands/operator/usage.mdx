# operator usage

Retrieve a client count report for the default reporting period or a specific
time range.

<CodeBlockConfig hideClipboard>

```shell-session
$ vault operator usage [flags]

$ vault operator usage [-help | -h]
```

</CodeBlockConfig>

## Description

`operator usage` retrieves a [client count](/vault/docs/concepts/client-count)
report for the default reporting period, or for a specific time range of
months.

The command output will list clients by distinct entities, non-entity tokens,
ACME clients, secret sync clients, and total active clients for each namespace,
and the total for the entire cluster. It may indicate that no data is available
for the requested time range, which may be because the client count reporting is
disabled, the time range is too far in the past, or no data has yet been
collected since the feature was enabled.

Refer to the [Vault Usage Metrics](/vault/tutorials/monitoring/usage-metrics)
tutorial to learn more about usage metrics, including required policy and data
collection details.
