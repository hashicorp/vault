# operator raft

This command groups subcommands for operators to manage the Integrated Storage Raft backend.

```text
Usage: vault operator raft <subcommand> [options] [args]

 This command groups subcommands for operators interacting with the Vault
 integrated Raft storage backend. Most users will not need to interact with these
 commands. Here are a few examples of the Raft operator commands:

Subcommands:
    join           Joins a node to the Raft cluster
    list-peers     Returns the Raft peer set
    remove-peer    Removes a node from the Raft cluster
    snapshot       Restores and saves snapshots from the Raft cluster
```

## join

This command is used to join a new node as a peer to the Raft cluster. In order
to join, there must be at least one existing member of the cluster. If Shamir
seal is in use, then unseal keys are to be supplied before or after the
join process, depending on whether it's being used exclusively for HA.

If raft is used for `storage`, the node must be joined before unsealing and the
`leader-api-addr` argument must be provided. If raft is used for `ha_storage`,
the node must be first unsealed before joining and the `leader-api-addr` must
_not_ be provided.

```text
Usage: vault operator raft join [options] <leader-api-addr>

  Join the current node as a peer to the Raft cluster by providing the address
  of the Raft leader node.

	  $ vault operator raft join "http://127.0.0.2:8200"
```

The `join` command also allows operators to specify cloud auto-join configuration
instead of a static IP address or hostname. When provided, Vault will attempt to
automatically discover and resolve potential leader addresses based on the provided
auto-join configuration.

Vault uses go-discover to support the auto-join functionality. Please see the
go-discover
[README](https://github.com/hashicorp/go-discover/blob/master/README.md) for
details on the format.

By default, Vault will attempt to reach discovered peers using HTTPS and port 8200.
Operators may override these through the `--auto-join-scheme` and `--auto-join-port`
CLI flags respectively.

```text
Usage: vault operator raft join [options] <auto-join-configuration>
  Join the current node as a peer to the Raft cluster by providing cloud auto-join
  metadata configuration.
    $ vault operator raft join "provider=aws region=eu-west-1 ..."
```

### Parameters

The following flags are available for the `operator raft join` command.

- `-leader-ca-cert` `(string: "")` - CA cert to communicate with Raft leader.

- `-leader-client-cert` `(string: "")` - Client cert to authenticate to Raft leader.

- `-leader-client-key` `(string: "")` - Client key to authenticate to Raft leader.

- `-non-voter` `(bool: false) (enterprise)` - This flag is used to make the
  server not participate in the Raft quorum, and have it only receive the data
  replication stream. This can be used to add read scalability to a cluster in
  cases where a high volume of reads to servers are needed. The default is false.
  See [`retry_join_as_non_voter`](/vault/docs/configuration/storage/raft#retry_join_as_non_voter)
  for the equivalent config option when using `retry_join` stanzas instead.

- `-retry` `(bool: false)` - Continuously retry joining the Raft cluster upon
  failures. The default is false.

~> **Note:** Please be aware that the content (not the path to the file) of the certificate or key is expected for these parameters: `-leader-ca-cert`, `-leader-client-cert`, `-leader-client-key`.

## list-peers

This command is used to list the full set of peers in the Raft cluster.

```text
Usage: vault operator raft list-peers

  Provides the details of all the peers in the Raft cluster.

	  $ vault operator raft list-peers
```

### Example output

```json
{
 ...
  "data": {
    "config": {
      "index": 62,
      "servers": [
        {
          "address": "127.0.0.2:8201",
          "leader": true,
          "node_id": "node1",
          "protocol_version": "3",
          "voter": true
        },
        {
          "address": "127.0.0.4:8201",
          "leader": false,
          "node_id": "node3",
          "protocol_version": "3",
          "voter": true
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

Use the output of `list-peers` to ensure that your cluster is in an expected state.
If you've removed a server using `remove-peer`, the server should no longer be
listed in the `list-peers` output. If you've added a server using `add-peer` or
through `retry_join`, check the `list-peers` output to see that it has been added
to the cluster and (if the node has not been added as a non-voter)
it has been promoted to a voter.

## remove-peer

This command is used to remove a node from being a peer to the Raft cluster. In
certain cases where a peer may be left behind in the Raft configuration even
though the server is no longer present and known to the cluster, this command
can be used to remove the failed server so that it is no longer affects the Raft
quorum.

```text
Usage: vault operator raft remove-peer <server_id>

  Removes a node from the Raft cluster.

	  $ vault operator raft remove-peer node1
```

<Note>
  Once a node is removed, its Raft data needs to be deleted before it may be joined back into an existing cluster. This requires shutting down the Vault process, deleting the data, then restarting the Vault process on the removed node.
</Note>

## snapshot

This command groups subcommands for operators interacting with the snapshot
functionality of the integrated Raft storage backend.

@include 'tips/manage-snapshots.mdx'

```text
Usage: vault operator raft snapshot <subcommand> [options] [args]

  This command groups subcommands for operators interacting with the snapshot
  functionality of the integrated Raft storage backend. Here are a few examples of
  the Raft snapshot operator commands:

  Installs the provided snapshot, returning the cluster to the state defined in it:

      $ vault operator raft snapshot restore raft.snap

  Saves a snapshot of the current state of the Raft cluster into a file:

      $ vault operator raft snapshot save raft.snap

  Inspects a snapshot based on a file:

      $ vault operator raft snapshot inspect raft.snap

  Please see the individual subcommand help for detailed usage information.

Subcommands:
    inspect    Inspects raft snapshot
    load       Loads the provided local or cloud storage snapshot
    restore    Installs the provided snapshot, returning the cluster to the state defined in it
    save       Saves a snapshot of the current state of the Raft cluster into a file
    unload     Unloads the snapshot with provided ID```
```

### snapshot inspect

Inspects a snapshot file taken from a Vault raft cluster and prints a table showing the number of keys and the amount of space used.

```text
Usage: vault operator raft snapshot inspect <snapshot_file>
```

For example:

```shell-session
$ vault operator raft snapshot inspect raft.snap
```

### snapshot load

@include 'alerts/enterprise-only.mdx'

Load a new snapshot into the Vault cluster without overwriting the cluster with
the snapshot's data.

@include 'recover/loadedsnapshots.mdx'

```text
Usage: vault operator raft snapshot load < SNAPSHOT_FILE | auto_snapshot_config=CONFIG_NAME url=URL >

  Loads the provided snapshot for reading or recovering data on supported paths.

  This command supports two modes of operation:

  1. Loading a local snapshot file from the filesystem.
     In this mode, the file path must be provided as the only positional argument.

         $ vault operator raft snapshot load raft.snap

  2. Loading a snapshot that was created by Vault's automated snapshot utility from cloud storage.
     In this case, the command accepts two K=V arguments: auto_snapshot_config and url.

         $ vault operator raft snapshot load auto_snapshot_config=foo url=https://foo.com/blob/snapshot
```

### snapshot restore

Restores a snapshot of Vault data taken with `vault operator raft snapshot save`.

```text
Usage: vault operator raft snapshot restore <snapshot_file>

  Installs the provided snapshot, returning the cluster to the state defined in it.

	  $ vault operator raft snapshot restore raft.snap
```

### snapshot save

Takes a snapshot of your Vault data. You can use the snapshot to restore Vault
to the point in time when you took the snapshot if you use integrated storage.
Vault does not support snapshots for deployments that only use raft for
high-availability storage.

```text
Usage: vault operator raft snapshot save <snapshot_file>

  Saves a snapshot of the current state of the Raft cluster into a file.

	  $ vault operator raft snapshot save raft.snap
```


### snapshot unload

@include 'alerts/enterprise-only.mdx'

Unload a snapshot previously loaded with `vault operator raft snapshot load`.

```text
Usage: vault operator raft snapshot unload <SNAPSHOT_ID>

  Unloads the snapshot with the provided ID.

      $ vault operator raft snapshot unload 8a4f31cc-7bb2-227a-aa18-8f140fb40f10
```

## autopilot

This command groups subcommands for operators interacting with the autopilot
functionality of the integrated Raft storage backend. There are 3 subcommands
supported: `get-config`, `set-config` and `state`.

For a more detailed overview of autopilot features, see the [concepts page](/vault/docs/concepts/integrated-storage/autopilot).

```text
Usage: vault operator raft autopilot <subcommand> [options] [args]

This command groups subcommands for operators interacting with the autopilot
functionality of the integrated Raft storage backend.

Subcommands:
    get-config    Returns the configuration of the autopilot subsystem under integrated storage
    set-config    Modify the configuration of the autopilot subsystem under integrated storage
    state         Displays the state of the raft cluster under integrated storage as seen by autopilot
```

### autopilot state

Displays the state of the raft cluster under integrated storage as seen by
autopilot. It shows whether autopilot thinks the cluster is healthy or not.

State includes a list of all servers by nodeID and IP address.

```text
Usage: vault operator raft autopilot state

  Displays the state of the raft cluster under integrated storage as seen by autopilot.

    $ vault operator raft autopilot state

The "Failure Tolerance" of a cluster is the number of nodes in the cluster that could
fail gradually without causing an outage.

When verifying the health of your cluster, check the following fields of each server:
- Healthy: whether Autopilot considers this node healthy or not
- Status: the voting status of the node. This will be `voter`, `leader`, or [`non-voter`](/vault/docs/concepts/integrated-storage#non-voting-nodes-enterprise-only).
- Last Index: the index of the last applied Raft log. This should be close to the "Last Index" value of the leader.
- Version: the version of Vault running on the server
- Node Type: the type of node. On CE, this will always be `voter`. See below for an explanation of Enterprise node types.

Vault Enterprise will include additional output related to automated upgrades, optimistic failure tolerance, and redundancy zones.

#### Example Vault enterprise output

### autopilot get-config

Returns the configuration of the autopilot subsystem under integrated storage.

```text
Usage: vault operator raft autopilot get-config

  Returns the configuration of the autopilot subsystem under integrated storage.

    $ vault operator raft autopilot get-config
```

### autopilot set-config

Modify the configuration of the autopilot subsystem under integrated storage.

```text
Usage: vault operator raft autopilot set-config [options]

  Modify the configuration of the autopilot subsystem under integrated storage.

	  $ vault operator raft autopilot set-config -server-stabilization-time 10s

```

Flags applicable to this command are the following:

- `cleanup-dead-servers` `(bool: false)` - Controls whether to remove dead servers from
  the Raft peer list periodically or when a new server joins. This requires that
  `min-quorum` is also set.

- `last-contact-threshold` `(string: "10s")` - Limit on the amount of time a server can
  go without leader contact before being considered unhealthy.

- `dead-server-last-contact-threshold` `(string: "24h")` - Limit on the amount of time
a server can go without leader contact before being considered failed. This
takes effect only when `cleanup_dead_servers` is set. When adding new nodes
to your cluster, the `dead_server_last_contact_threshold` needs to be larger
than the amount of time that it takes to load a Raft snapshot, otherwise the
newly added nodes will be removed from your cluster before they have finished
loading the snapshot and starting up. If you are using an [HSM](/vault/docs/enterprise/hsm), your
`dead_server_last_contact_threshold` needs to be larger than the response
time of the HSM.

<Warning>

  We strongly recommend keeping `dead_server_last_contact_threshold` at a high
  duration, such as a day, as it being too low could result in removal of nodes
  that aren't actually dead

</Warning>

- `max-trailing-logs` `(int: 1000)` - Amount of entries in the Raft Log that a server
  can be behind before being considered unhealthy. If this value is too low,
  it can cause the cluster to lose quorum if a follower falls behind. This
  value only needs to be increased from the default if you have a very high
  write load on Vault and you see that it takes a long time to promote new
  servers to becoming voters. This is an unlikely scenario and most users
  should not modify this value.

- `min-quorum` `(int)` - The minimum number of servers that should always be
present in a cluster. Autopilot will not prune servers below this number.
**There is no default for this value** and it should be set to the expected
number of voters in your cluster when `cleanup_dead_servers` is set as `true`.
Use the [quorum size guidance](/vault/docs/internals/integrated-storage#quorum-size-and-failure-tolerance)
to determine the proper minimum quorum size for your cluster.

- `server-stabilization-time` `(string: "10s")` - Minimum amount of time a server must be in a healthy state before it
  can become a voter. Until that happens, it will be visible as a peer in the cluster, but as a non-voter, meaning it
  won't contribute to quorum.

- `disable-upgrade-migration` `(bool: false)` - Controls whether to disable automated
  upgrade migrations, an Enterprise-only feature.
