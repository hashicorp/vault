# operator step-down

Forces the Vault server at the given address to step down from active duty.

<CodeBlockConfig hideClipboard>

```shell-session
$ vault operator step-down [flags]

$ vault operator step-down [-help | -h]
```

</CodeBlockConfig>

## Description

`operator step-down` forces the active Vault node within an 
[HA cluster](/vault/docs/concepts/ha) to step down from active duty. 
When executed against a non-active node (for example, a standby or 
[performance standby](/vault/docs/enterprise/performance-standby) node), the 
request will be forwarded to the active node.  

While the node steps down, it will have a delay before attempting to acquire 
the leader lock again. If no other Vault nodes acquire the lock beforehand, it 
is possible for the same node to re-acquire the lock and become active again. 
Due to the locking architecture, there may be a period of time before another 
node grabs the lock and finishes transitioning to active operation where the 
cluster has no active node. During the period where none of the nodes are active, 
forwarding of requests to the leader node will fail.
