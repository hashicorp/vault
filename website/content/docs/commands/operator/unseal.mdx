# operator unseal

Provide a portion of the root key to unseal a Vault server.


<CodeBlockConfig hideClipboard>

```shell-session
$ vault operator unseal [flags]

$ vault operator unseal [-help | -h]
```

</CodeBlockConfig>

## Description

`operator unseal` provides a portion of the root key to unseal a Vault server. 
Vault starts in a sealed state. It cannot perform operations until it is 
unsealed. This command accepts a portion of the master key (an "unseal key").

The unseal key can be supplied as an argument to the command, but we do not
recommend this approach since the unseal key will be available in your history:

```shell-session
$ vault operator unseal IXyR0OJnSFobekZMMCKCoVEpT7wI6l+USMzE3IcyDyo=
```

Instead, run the command with no arguments and it will prompt for the key:

```shell-session
$ vault operator unseal
Key (will be hidden): IXyR0OJnSFobekZMMCKCoVEpT7wI6l+USMzE3IcyDyo=
```

For more information on sealing and unsealing, refer to the [seal concepts
page](/vault/docs/concepts/seal).
