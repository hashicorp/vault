# operator utilization

The `operator utilization` allows the Vault Enterprise users to generate license
utilization reporting bundles. When users have disabled automated license
reporting, use this command to manually generate the report and send it to
HashiCorp.

<Note title="Vault Enterprise">

Refer to the [manual license utilization
reporting](/vault/docs/enterprise/license/manual-reporting) page to learn more
about reporting your Vault Enterprise license utilization.

</Note>

## Examples

Create a license utilization bundle that includes all persisted historical
snapshots and has the default bundle name
(`vault-utilization-<time_stamp>.json`):

```shell-session
$ vault operator utilization
Success! License utilization reporting bundle written to: vault-utilization-2024-02-16T22-23-25Z.json
```

Create a license utilization bundle with a message about the bundle, and output
the file at the specified path, `/utilization/reports/latest.json`.

```shell-session
$ vault operator utilization \
    -message="Change Control 654987" \
    -output="/utilization/reports/latest.json"
```

**Example output:**

<CodeBlockConfig hideClipboard>

```plaintext
Success! License utilization reporting bundle written to: /utilization/reports/latest.json
```

</CodeBlockConfig>

The message, `Change Control 654987`, is included in the _server log_, but not
in the bundle.

**Example entry in the server log:**

<CodeBlockConfig hideClipboard>

```plaintext
[INFO]  reporting: generating license utilization bundle
[INFO]  reporting: generating license utilization bundle: message="Change Control 654987"
```

</CodeBlockConfig>

## Usage

The following flags are available in addition to the [standard set of
flags](/vault/docs/commands) included on all commands.

### Command options

- `-message` `(string; "")` - Provide context about the conditions under which
the report was generated and submitted. This message is not included in the
license utilization bundle but will be included in the vault server logs.

- `-output` `(string; "")` - Specifies the output path for the bundle. Defaults
to a time-based generated file name.

- `-today-only` `(bool: false)` - To include only todayâ€™s snapshot, no
historical snapshots. If no snapshots were persisted in the last 24 hrs, it
takes a snapshot and exports it to a bundle.
