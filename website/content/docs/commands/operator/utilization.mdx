$ vault operator utilization [-help | -h]
```

`operator utilization` produces a bundle of snapshots that contains license
utilization data. If no snapshots were persisted in the last 24 hrs, it takes a
snapshot and includes it in the bundle to prevent stale data.

reporting](/vault/docs/enterprise/license/manual-reporting) page to learn more
about reporting your Vault Enterprise license utilization.

## Examples

Create a license utilization bundle that includes all persisted historical
snapshots and has the default bundle name (`vault-utilization-<time_stamp>.json`):

```shell-session
$ vault operator utilization
Success! License utilization reporting bundle written to: vault-utilization-2024-02-16T22-23-25Z.json
```

Create a license utilization bundle with a message about the bundle, and output
the file at the specified path, `/utilization/reports/latest.json`.

```shell-session
$ vault operator utilization \
    -message="Change Control 654987" \
    -output="/utilization/reports/latest.json"
```

**Example output:**

<CodeBlockConfig hideClipboard>

```plaintext
Success! License utilization reporting bundle written to: /utilization/reports/latest.json
```

</CodeBlockConfig>

The message, `Change Control 654987`, is included in the _server log_, but not
in the bundle.

<CodeBlockConfig hideClipboard>

```plaintext
[INFO]  reporting: generating license utilization bundle
[INFO]  reporting: generating license utilization bundle: message="Change Control 654987"
```

</CodeBlockConfig>

Create a license utilization bundle with only today's snapshot:

```shell-session
$ vault operator utilization -today-only
```

Create a license utilization bundle with a specific name:

```shell-session
$ vault operator utilization -output="/utilization/reports/latest.json"
```
