# operator rotate

Rotates the underlying encryption key which is used to secure data written
to the storage backend.

<CodeBlockConfig hideClipboard>

```shell-session
$ vault operator rotate [flags]

$ vault operator rotate [-help | -h]
```

</CodeBlockConfig>

## Description

`operator rotate` rotates the underlying encryption key, which secures data
written to storage. This installs a new key in the key ring. This new key
encrypts new data, while older keys in the ring decrypt older data.

This is an online operation and does not cause downtime. This command runs
per-cluster (not per-server), since Vault servers in HA mode share the same
storage.

Vault will automatically rotate the encryption key before reaching 2<sup>32</sup>
encryption operations, in adherence with NIST SP800-32D guidelines.

## Examples

Rotate Vault's encryption key:

```shell-session
$ vault operator rotate
Key Term        3
Install Time    01 May 17 10:30 UTC
```

View the current automatic rotation policy:

```shell-session
$ vault read sys/rotate/config
```

Configure a time interval for automatic key rotation:

```shell-session
$ vault write sys/rotate/config interval=2160h
Success! Data written to: sys/rotate/config
```

Configure the maximum number of encryption operations per key:

```shell-session
$ vault write sys/rotate/config max_operations=123456789
Success! Data written to: sys/rotate/config
```
