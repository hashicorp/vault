# operator seal

Seals the Vault server.

```shell-session
$ vault operator seal [flags]

$ vault operator seal [-help | -h]
```

</CodeBlockConfig>

## Description

`operator seal` seals the Vault server. Sealing tells the Vault server to
stop responding to any operations until it is unsealed. When sealed, the Vault
server discards its in-memory root key to unlock the data, so it is physically
blocked from responding to operations unsealed.

If an unseal is in progress, sealing the Vault will reset the unsealing process.
Users will have to re-enter their portions of the root key again.

This command does nothing if the Vault server is already sealed.

For more information on sealing and unsealing, refer to the [seal concepts
page](/vault/docs/concepts/seal).
