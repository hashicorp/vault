## Description

`operator raft list-peers` provides the details of all the peers in the Raft 
cluster.

Use the output of `list-peers` to ensure that your cluster is in an expected 
state. If you have removed a server using `remove-peer`, the server should no
longer be listed in the `list-peers` output. If you have added a server using 
`add-peer` or through `retry_join`, check the `list-peers` output to see that 
it has been added to the cluster and (if the node has not been added as a 
non-voter) it has been promoted to a voter.
