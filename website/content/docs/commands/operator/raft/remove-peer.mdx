# operator raft join

Removes a node from the Raft cluster.

<CodeBlockConfig hideClipboard>

```shell-session
$ vault operator raft remove-peer [flags] <server-id>

$ vault operator raft remove-peer [-help | -h]
```

</CodeBlockConfig>

## Description

`operator raft remove-peer` removes a node from the Raft cluster.

This command is useful when a server node is no longer available or accessible,
but remains in the Raft configuration. By removing the failed server from the
configuration, you ensure it no longer impacts the Raft quorum requirements
for cluster operations. This helps maintain proper cluster functionality even
after node failures.

<Note>

Once a node is removed, its Raft data needs to be deleted before it may be 
joined back into an existing cluster. This requires shutting down the Vault 
process, deleting the data, then restarting the Vault process on the removed node.
