# auth list

The `auth list` command lists the auth methods enabled. The output lists the
enabled auth methods and options for those methods.

## Deprecation status column

As of 1.12, all built-in auth engines will have an associated Deprecation
Status. This status will be reflected in the `Deprecation Status` column, seen
below. All auth engines which are not provided by built-in plugins will show a
`Deprecation Status` of "n/a".

## Version columns

The `-detailed` view displays some version information for each mount.

The Version field indicates the configured version for the plugin. Empty, or "n/a",
indicates the built-in or any matching unversioned plugin that may have been registered.

Running Version indicates the actual plugin version running, which may differ from
Version if the plugin hasn't been reloaded since the configured version was updated
using the `secrets tune` command. Finally, the Running SHA256 field indicates the
SHA256 sum of the running plugin's binary. This may be different from the SHA256
registered in the catalog if the plugin hasn't been reloaded since the plugin
version was overwritten in the catalog.

## Examples

List all auth methods:

```shell-session
$ vault auth list

```

```shell-session
