# auth tune

The `auth tune` command tunes the configuration options for the auth method at
the given PATH. 

<Note>

The argument corresponds to the **path** where the auth method is
enabled, not the auth **type**.

</Note>

## Examples

Before tuning the auth method configuration, view the current configuration of the
auth method enabled at `github/`.

```shell-session
$ vault read sys/auth/github/tune
Key                  Value
---                  -----
default_lease_ttl    768h
description          n/a
force_no_cache       false
max_lease_ttl        768h
token_type           default-service
```

The default lease for the auth method enabled at `github/` is currently set to
768 hours. Tune this value to 72 hours.

```shell-session
$ vault auth tune -default-lease-ttl=72h github/
Success! Tuned the auth method at: github/
```

Verify the updated configuration.

<CodeBlockConfig highlight="1,4">

```shell-session
$ vault read sys/auth/github/tune
Key                  Value
---                  -----
default_lease_ttl    72h
description          n/a
force_no_cache       false
max_lease_ttl        768h
token_type           default-service
```

</CodeBlockConfig>

To restore back to the system default, you can use `-1`. 

```shell-session
$ vault auth tune -default-lease-ttl=-1 github/
Success! Tuned the auth method at: github/
```

Verify the updated configuration.

<CodeBlockConfig highlight="1,4">

```shell-session
$ vault read sys/auth/github/tune
Key                  Value
---                  -----
default_lease_ttl    768h
description          n/a
force_no_cache       false
max_lease_ttl        768h
token_type           default-service
```

</CodeBlockConfig>

You can specify multiple audit non-hmac request keys.

```shell-session
$ vault auth tune -audit-non-hmac-request-keys=value1 -audit-non-hmac-request-keys=value2 github/
Success! Tuned the auth method at: github/
```

### Enable user lockout

User lockout feature is only supported for
[userpass](/vault/docs/auth/userpass), [ldap](/vault/docs/auth/ldap), and
[approle](/vault/docs/auth/approle) auth methods.

Tune the `userpass/` auth method to lock out the user after 10 failed login
attempts within 10 minutes.

```shell-session
$ vault auth tune -user-lockout-threshold=10  -user-lockout-duration=10m userpass/
Success! Tuned the auth method at: userpass/
```

View the current configuration of the auth method enabled at `userpass/`.

<CodeBlockConfig highlight="1,11-13">

```shell-session
$ vault read sys/auth/userpass/tune

Key                  Value
---                  -----
default_lease_ttl    768h
description          n/a
force_no_cache       false
max_lease_ttl        768h
token_type           default-service
user_lockout_counter_reset_duration    0s
user_lockout_disable                   false
user_lockout_duration                  10m
user_lockout_threshold                 10
```

## Usage

The following flags are available in addition to the [standard set of
flags](/vault/docs/commands) included on all commands.

- `-allowed-response-headers` `(string: "")` - response header values that the auth
  method will be allowed to set.

- `-audit-non-hmac-request-keys` `(string: "")` - Key that will not be HMAC'd
  by audit devices in the request data object. Note that multiple keys may be
  specified by providing this option multiple times, each time with 1 key.

- `-audit-non-hmac-response-keys` `(string: "")` - Key that will not be HMAC'd
  by audit devices in the response data object. Note that multiple keys may be
  specified by providing this option multiple times, each time with 1 key.

- `-default-lease-ttl` `(duration: "")` - The default lease TTL for this auth
  method. If unspecified, this defaults to the Vault server's globally
  configured default lease TTL, or a previously configured value for the auth
  method.

- `-description` `(string: "")` - Specifies the description of the auth method.
  This overrides the current stored value, if any.

- `-listing-visibility` `(string: "")` - The flag to toggle whether to show the
  mount in the UI-specific listing endpoint. Valid values are `"unauth"` or `"hidden"`.
  Passing empty string leaves the current setting unchanged.

- `-max-lease-ttl` `(duration: "")` - The maximum lease TTL for this auth
  method. If unspecified, this defaults to the Vault server's globally
  configured [maximum lease TTL](/vault/docs/configuration#max_lease_ttl), or a
  previously configured value for the auth method. This value is allowed to
  override the server's global max TTL; it can be longer or shorter.

- `-passthrough-request-headers` `(string: "")` - request header values that will
  be sent to the auth method. Note that multiple keys may be
  specified by providing this option multiple times, each time with 1 key.

- `-token-type` `(string: "")` - Specifies the type of tokens that should be
  returned by the auth method.

- `-trim-request-trailing-slashes` `(bool: false)` - If true, requests to
  this mount with trailing slashes will have those slashes trimmed. 
  Necessary for some standards based APIs handled by Vault.

- `-plugin-version` `(string: "")` - Configures the semantic version of the plugin
  to use. The new version will not start running until the mount is
  [reloaded](/vault/docs/commands/plugin/reload).

- `-user-lockout-threshold` `(string: "")` - Specifies the number of failed login attempts 
  after which the user is locked out. User lockout feature was added in Vault 1.13. 

- `-user-lockout-duration` `(duration: "")` - Specifies the duration for which a user will be locked out.
  User lockout feature was added in Vault 1.13.

- `-user-lockout-counter-reset-duration` `(duration: "")` - Specifies the duration after which the lockout 
  counter is reset with no failed login attempts. User lockout feature was added in Vault 1.13.

- `-user-lockout-disable` `(bool: false)` - Disables the user lockout feature if set to true. User lockout feature was added in Vault 1.13.
