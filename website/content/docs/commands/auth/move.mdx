# auth move

The `auth move` command moves an existing auth method to a new path. Any
leases from the old auth method are revoked, but all configuration associated
with the engine is preserved. The command can be issued for a move within or across
namespaces, using namespace prefixes in the arguments.

The command will trigger a remount operation and uses the returned migration ID to poll the 
status of the operation until a terminal state of `success` or `failure` is reached.

**Moving an existing auth method will revoke any leases from the old
method.**

## Examples

Move the existing auth method at ns1/approle/ to ns2/new-approle/:

```shell-session
$ vault auth move ns1/auth/approle/ ns2/auth/new-approle/
```

Move the existing auth method `auth/userpass` to the `education/certification/approle` namespace.

```shell-session
$ vault auth move auth/userpass education/certification/auth/userpass
```

## Usage

There are no flags beyond the [standard set of flags](/vault/docs/commands)
included on all commands.

## Post-move considerations

Each namespace has its own policies, auth methods, secrets engines, tokens,
identity entities and groups. You must consider the following after moving a mount across namespaces:

- Necessary policies exist in the target namespace
- Entities and groups might need updates after an auth method move
