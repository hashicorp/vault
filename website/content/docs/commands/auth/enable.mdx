# auth enable

The `auth enable` command enables an auth method at a given path. If an auth
method already exists at the given path, an error is returned. After the auth
method is enabled, it usually needs configuration. The configuration varies by
auth method.

An auth method is responsible for authenticating users or machines and assigning
them policies and a token with which they can access Vault. Authentication is
usually mapped to policy. Please see the [policies
concepts](/vault/docs/concepts/policies) page for more information.

## Examples

Enable the auth method "userpass" enabled at "userpass/":

```shell-session
$ vault auth enable userpass
Success! Enabled the userpass auth method at: userpass/
```

Create a user:

```shell-session
$ vault write auth/userpass/users/sethvargo password=secret
Success! Data written to: auth/userpass/users/sethvargo
```

For more information on the specific configuration options and paths, please see
the [auth method](/vault/docs/auth) documentation.

## Usage

The following flags are available in addition to the [standard set of
flags](/vault/docs/commands) included on all commands.

- `-audit-non-hmac-request-keys` `(string: "")` - Key that will not be HMAC'd
  by audit devices in the request data object. Note that multiple keys may be
  specified by providing this option multiple times, each time with 1 key.
  An example of this is provided in the [tune section](/vault/docs/commands/auth/tune).

- `-audit-non-hmac-response-keys` `(string: "")` - Key that will not be HMAC'd
  by audit devices in the response data object. Note that multiple keys may be
  specified by providing this option multiple times, each time with 1 key.

- `-default-lease-ttl` `(duration: "")` - The default lease TTL for this auth
  method. If unspecified, this defaults to the Vault server's globally
  configured default lease TTL, or a previously configured value for the auth
  method. Uses [duration format strings](/vault/docs/concepts/duration-format).

- `-passthrough-request-headers` `(string: "")` - request header values that will
  be sent to the auth method. Note that multiple keys may be
  specified by providing this option multiple times, each time with 1 key.

- `-allowed-response-headers` `(string: "")` - response header values that the auth
  method will be allowed to set. Note that multiple keys may be
  specified by providing this option multiple times, each time with 1 key.

- `-description` `(string: "")` - Human-friendly description for the purpose of
  this auth method.

- `-listing-visibility` `(string: "")` - The flag to toggle whether to show the
  mount in the UI-specific listing endpoint. Valid values are `"unauth"` or `"hidden"`,
  with the default `""` being equivalent to `"hidden"`.


- `-local` `(bool: false)` - Mark the auth method as local-only. Local auth
  methods are not replicated nor removed by replication.

- `-max-lease-ttl` `(string: "")` - The maximum lease duration, specified as
  a string duration like "5s" or "30m".

- `-path` `(string: "")` - Place where the auth method will be accessible. This
  must be unique across all auth methods. This defaults to the "type" of the
  auth method. The auth method will be accessible at `/auth/<path>`.

- `-seal-wrap` `(bool: false)` - Enable seal wrapping for the mount, causing
  values stored by the mount to be wrapped by the seal's encryption capability.

- `-token-type` `(string: "")` - Specifies the type of tokens that should be
  returned by the auth method.

- `-trim-request-trailing-slashes` `(bool: false)` - If true, requests to
  this mount with trailing slashes will have those slashes trimmed.
  Necessary for some standards based APIs handled by Vault.

- `-plugin-version` `(string: "")` - Configures the semantic version of the plugin
  to use. If unspecified, implies the built-in or any matching unversioned plugin
  that may have been registered.
