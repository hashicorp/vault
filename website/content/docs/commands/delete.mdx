# delete

The `delete` command deletes secrets and configuration from Vault at the given
path (wrapper command for HTTP DELETE). The behavior of "delete" is delegated to
the backend corresponding to the given path.

## Examples

Remove data in the static secrets engine:

```shell-session
$ vault delete secret/my-secret
```

Uninstall an encryption key in the transit backend:

```shell-session
$ vault delete transit/keys/my-key
```

Note: changing the `deletion_allowed` parameter to `true` is necessary for the
key to be successfully deleted, you can read more on key parameters [here](/vault/api-docs/secret/transit#update-key-configuration)

Delete an IAM role:

```shell-session
$ vault delete aws/roles/ops
```

## Usage

There are no flags beyond the [standard set of flags](/vault/docs/commands)
included on all commands.
