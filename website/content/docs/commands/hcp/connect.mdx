# hcp connect

Authenticate users or machines to HCP then cache the connection token and address locally.

<CodeBlockConfig hideClipboard>

```shell-session
$ vault hcp connect [options]
$ vault hcp connect [-help | -h]
```

</CodeBlockConfig>

## Description

Use `hcp connect` to authenticate with explicit credentials or interactive browser login.
By default, `hcp connect` uses interactive authentication that requires
users to log into the HashiCorp Cloud Platform with a browser.

Non-interactive login requires a service principal credential that was
previously generated through the HCP portal. The service principal must have
access to the requested organization, project, and HCP Vault Dedicated cluster.

If authentication succeeds, the Vault CLI saves the returned HCP token and HCP
Vault address in the local cache.
