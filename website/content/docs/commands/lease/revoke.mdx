# lease revoke

Revokes the lease on a secret, invalidating the underlying secret.

<CodeBlockConfig hideClipboard>

```shell-session
$ vault lease revoke [flags] <id>

$ vault lease revoke [-help | -h]
```

</CodeBlockConfig>

## Description

`lease revoke` revokes the lease on a secret, invalidating the underlying secret.

This command can revoke a single secret or multiple secrets based on a
path-matched prefix.

The default behavior when not using `-force` is to revoke asynchronously. Vault
will queue the revocation and keep trying if it fails (including across
restarts). You can use the `-sync` flag to force a synchronous operation, but
it is then up to the caller to retry on failure. Force mode always operates
synchronously.

## Examples

Revoke a single lease:

```shell-session
$ vault lease revoke database/creds/readonly/27e1b9a1-27b8-83d9-9fe0-d99d786bdc83
Success! Revoked lease: database/creds/readonly/27e1b9a1-27b8-83d9-9fe0-d99d786bdc83
```

Revoke a lease which starts with a prefix:

```shell-session
$ vault lease revoke -prefix database/creds
Success! Revoked any leases with prefix: database/creds
```

Force delete leases from Vault even if secret engine revocation fails:

```shell-session
$ vault lease revoke -force -prefix consul/creds
Success! Revoked any leases with prefix: consul/creds
```
