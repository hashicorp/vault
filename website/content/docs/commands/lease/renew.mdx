# lease renew

Renews the lease on a secret, extending the time that it can be used before 
Vault revokes it.

<CodeBlockConfig hideClipboard>

```shell-session
$ vault lease renew [flags] <id>

$ vault lease renew [-help | -h]
```

</CodeBlockConfig>

## Description

`lease renew` renews the lease on a secret, extending the time that
it can be used before it is revoked by Vault.

Every secret in Vault has a lease associated with it. If the owner of the
secret wants to use it longer than the lease, then it must be renewed.
Renewing the lease does not change the contents of the secret. The ID is the
full path lease ID.

Lease renewal will fail if the secret is not renewable, the secret has already
been revoked, or if the secret has already reached its maximum TTL.
