# audit enable

The `audit enable` command enables an audit device at a given path. If an audit
device already exists at the given path, an error is returned. Additional
options for configuring the audit device are provided as `KEY=VALUE`. Each audit
device declares its own set of configuration options.

Once an audit device is enabled, almost every request and response will be
logged to the device.

## Examples

Enable the audit device "file" enabled at "file/":

```shell-session
$ vault audit enable file file_path=/tmp/my-file.txt
Success! Enabled the file audit device at: file/
```

## Usage

The following flags are available in addition to the [standard set of
flags](/vault/docs/commands) included on all commands.

- `-description` `(string: "")` - Human-friendly description for the purpose of
  this audit device.

- `-local` `(bool: false)` - Mark the audit device as a local-only device.
  Local devices are not replicated or removed by replication.

- `-path` `(string: "")` - Place where the audit device will be accessible. This
  must be unique across all audit devices. This defaults to the "type" of the
  audit device.

All audit devices support the following common options which can be supplied after
the flags documented above:

@include 'audit-options-common.mdx'

For device specific options, refer to the relevant audit device type under the [Audit Devices](/vault/docs/audit)
overview.
