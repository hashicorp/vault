# server

The `server` command starts a Vault server that responds to API requests. By
default, Vault will start in a "sealed" state. The Vault cluster must be
initialized before use, usually by the `vault operator init` command. Each Vault
server must also be unsealed using the `vault operator unseal` command or the
API before the server can respond to requests.

For more information, please see:

- [`operator init` command](/vault/docs/commands/operator/init) for information
  on initializing a Vault server.

- [`operator unseal` command](/vault/docs/commands/operator/unseal) for
  information on providing unseal keys.

- [Vault configuration](/vault/docs/configuration) for the syntax and
  various configuration options for a Vault server.

## Examples

Start a server with a configuration file:

```shell-session
$ vault server -config=/etc/vault/config.hcl
```

Run in "dev" mode with a custom initial root token:

```shell-session
$ vault server -dev -dev-root-token-id="root"
```

## Usage

The following flags are available in addition to the [standard set of
flags](/vault/docs/commands) included on all commands.

### Command options

- `-config` `(string: "")` - Path to a configuration file or directory of
  configuration files. This flag can be specified multiple times to load
  multiple configurations. If the path is a directory, all files which end in
  .hcl or .json are loaded.

- `-log-level` ((#\_log_level)) `(string: "info")` - Log verbosity level. Supported values (in
  order of descending detail) are `trace`, `debug`, `info`, `warn`, and `error`. This can
  also be specified via the `VAULT_LOG_LEVEL` environment variable.

- `-log-format` ((#\_log_format)) `(string: "standard")` - Log format. Supported values
  are `standard` and `json`. This can also be specified via the
  `VAULT_LOG_FORMAT` environment variable.

- `-log-file` ((#\_log_file)) - The absolute path where Vault should save log
  messages in addition to other, existing outputs like journald / stdout. Paths
  that end with a path separator use the default file name, `vault.log`. Paths
  that do not end with a file extension use the default `.log` extension. If the
  log file rotates, Vault appends the current timestamp to the file name
  at the time of rotation. For example:

  | `log-file`              | Full log file           | Rotated log file                    |
  |-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------------------|
  | `/var/log`              | `/var/log/vault.log`    | `/var/log/vault-{timestamp}.log`    |
  | `/var/log/my-diary`     | `/var/log/my-diary.log` | `/var/log/my-diary-{timestamp}.log` |
  | `/var/log/my-diary.txt` | `/var/log/my-diary.txt` | `/var/log/my-diary-{timestamp}.txt` |

- `-log-rotate-bytes` ((#\_log_rotate_bytes)) - to specify the number of
  bytes that should be written to a log before it needs to be rotated. Unless specified,
  there is no limit to the number of bytes that can be written to a log file.

- `-log-rotate-duration` ((#\_log_rotate_duration)) - to specify the maximum
  duration a log should be written to before it needs to be rotated. Must be a duration
  value such as 30s. Defaults to 24h.

- `-log-rotate-max-files` ((#\_log_rotate_max_files)) - to specify the maximum
  number of older log file archives to keep. Defaults to 0 (no files are ever deleted).
  Set to -1 to discard old log files when a new one is created.

- `-experiment` `(string array: [])` - The name of an experiment to enable for this node.
  This flag can be specified multiple times to enable multiple experiments. Experiments
  should NOT be used in production, and the associated APIs may have backwards incompatible
  changes between releases. Additional experiments can also be specified via the
  `VAULT_EXPERIMENTS` environment variable as a comma-separated list, or via the
  [`experiments`](/vault/docs/configuration#experiments) config key.

- `-pprof-dump-dir` `(string: "")` - Directory where the generated profiles are
  created. Vault does not generate profiles when `pprof-dump-dir` is unset.
  Use `pprof-dump-dir` temporarily during debugging sessions. Do not use
  `pprof-dump-dir` in regular production processes.

- `VAULT_ALLOW_PENDING_REMOVAL_MOUNTS` `(bool: false)` - (environment variable)
  Allow Vault to be started with builtin engines which have the `Pending Removal`
  deprecation state. This is a temporary stopgap in place in order to perform an
  upgrade and disable these engines. Once these engines are marked `Removed` (in
  the next major release of Vault), the environment variable will no longer work
  and a downgrade must be performed in order to remove the offending engines. For
  more information, see the [deprecation faq](/vault/docs/deprecation/faq/#q-what-are-the-phases-of-deprecation).

### Dev options

- `-dev` `(bool: false)` - Enable development mode. In this mode, Vault runs
  in-memory and starts unsealed. As the name implies, do not run "dev" mode in
  production.

- `-dev-tls` `(bool: false)` - Enable TLS development mode. In this mode, Vault runs
  in-memory and starts unsealed with a generated TLS CA, certificate and key.
  As the name implies, do not run "dev" mode in production.

- `-dev-tls-cert-dir` `(string: "")` - Directory where generated TLS files are created if `-dev-tls` is specified. If left unset, files are generated in a temporary directory.

- `-dev-listen-address` `(string: "127.0.0.1:8200")` - Address to bind to in
  "dev" mode. This can also be specified via the `VAULT_DEV_LISTEN_ADDRESS`
  environment variable.

- `-dev-root-token-id` `(string: "")` - Initial root token. This only applies
  when running in "dev" mode. This can also be specified via the
  `VAULT_DEV_ROOT_TOKEN_ID` environment variable.

  _Note:_ The token ID should not start with the `s.` prefix.

- `-dev-no-store-token` `(string: "")` - Do not persist the dev root token to
  the token helper (usually the local filesystem) for use in future requests.
  The token will only be displayed in the command output.

- `-dev-plugin-dir` `(string: "")` - Directory from which plugins are allowed to be loaded. Only applies in "dev" mode, it will automatically register all the plugins in the provided directory.
