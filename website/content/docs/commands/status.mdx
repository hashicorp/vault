sealed and if HA mode is enabled. This command prints regardless of whether the
Vault is sealed.

The exit code reflects the seal status:

In addition to the exit code, the output includes the following fields:

- `Sealed` - Indicates whether the Vault is sealed.
- `Key Shares` - The number of key shares required to reconstruct the root key.
- `Key Threshold` - The number of key shares required to reconstruct the root key.
- `Unseal Progress` - The number of shares unsealed.
- `Unseal Nonce` - The nonce used in the current unseal operation, if any.
