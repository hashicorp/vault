# status

The `status` command prints the current state of Vault including whether it is
sealed and if HA mode is enabled. This command prints regardless of whether the
Vault is sealed.

The exit code reflects the seal status:

- 0 - unsealed
- 1 - error
- 2 - sealed

## Examples

Print the current Vault status:

```shell-session
$ vault status
```

Example output of a Vault server running in development mode.
