# secrets move

The `secrets move` command moves an existing secrets engine to a new path. Any
leases from the old secrets engine are revoked, but all configuration associated
with the engine is preserved. The command can be issued for a move within or across
namespaces, using namespace prefixes in the arguments.

The command will trigger a remount operation and uses the returned migration ID to poll the 
status of the operation until a terminal state of `success` or `failure` is reached.

**Moving an existing secrets engine will revoke any leases from the old
engine.**

## Examples

Move the existing secrets engine at ns1/secret/ to ns2/kv/:

```shell-session
$ vault secrets move ns1/secret/ ns2/kv/
```

Move the existing secrets in `team-vault` to the `vault-edu/` namespace.

```shell-session
$ vault secrets move team-vault \
    vault-edu/team-vault
```

## Usage

There are no flags beyond the [standard set of flags](/vault/docs/commands)
included on all commands.

## Post-move considerations

Each namespace has its own policies, auth methods, secrets engines, tokens,
identity entities and groups. You must consider the following after moving a mount across namespaces:

- Necessary policies exist in the target namespace
- Entities and groups might need updating after an auth mount migration
