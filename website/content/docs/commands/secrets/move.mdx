# secrets move

Moves an existing secrets engine to a new path.

<CodeBlockConfig hideClipboard>

```shell-session
$ vault secrets move [flags] <source> <destination>

$ vault secrets move [-help | -h]
```

</CodeBlockConfig>

## Description

The `secrets move` command moves an existing secrets engine to a new path. Any
leases from the old secrets engine are revoked, but all configuration associated
with the engine is preserved. The command can be issued for a move within or across
namespaces, using namespace prefixes in the arguments.

The command will trigger a remount operation and uses the returned migration ID to poll the 
status of the operation until a terminal state of `success` or `failure` is reached.

<Warning>

Moving an existing secrets engine will revoke any leases from the old
engine.

</Warning>

### Post-move considerations

Each namespace has its own policies, auth methods, secrets engines, tokens,
identity entities and groups. You must consider the following after moving a mount across namespaces:

- Necessary policies exist in the target namespace
- Entities and groups might need updating after an auth mount migration
