# secrets list

The `secrets list` command lists the enabled secrets engines on the Vault server.
This command also outputs information about the enabled path including
configured TTLs and human-friendly descriptions. A TTL of "system" indicates
that the system default is in use.

## Deprecation status column

As of 1.12, all built-in secrets engines will have an associated Deprecation
Status. This status will be reflected in the `Deprecation Status` column, seen
below. All secrets engines which are not provided by built-in plugins will show a
`Deprecation Status` of "n/a".

## Version columns

The `-detailed` view displays some version information for each mount.

The Version field indicates the configured version for the plugin. Empty, or "n/a",
indicates the built-in or any matching unversioned plugin that may have been registered.

Running Version indicates the actual plugin version running, which may differ from
Version if the plugin hasn't been reloaded since the configured version was updated
using the `secrets tune` command. Finally, the Running SHA256 field indicates the
SHA256 sum of the running plugin's binary. This may be different from the SHA256
registered in the catalog if the plugin hasn't been reloaded since the plugin
version was overwritten in the catalog.

## Examples

List all enabled secrets engines:

```shell-session
$ vault secrets list
Path          Type         Accessor              Description
----          ----         --------              -----------
cubbyhole/    cubbyhole    cubbyhole_548b4dc5    per-token private secret storage
secret/       kv           identity_aa00c06d     key/value secret storage
sys/          system       system_547412e3       system endpoints used for control, policy and debugging
```

List all enabled secrets engines with detailed output:

```shell-session
$ vault secrets list -detailed
