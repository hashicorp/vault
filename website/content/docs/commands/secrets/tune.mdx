# secrets tune

The `secrets tune` command tunes the configuration options for the secrets
engine at the given PATH. The argument corresponds to the PATH where the secrets
engine is enabled, not the type.

## Examples

Before tuning the secret mount, view the current configuration of the
mount enabled at "pki/":

```shell-session
$ vault read sys/mounts/pki/tune
Key                             Value
---                             -----
default_lease_ttl               12h
description                     Example PKI mount
force_no_cache                  false
max_lease_ttl                   24h
```

Tune the default lease, exclude `common_name` and `serial_number` from being HMAC'd in the audit log for the PKI secrets engine:

```shell-session
$ vault secrets tune -default-lease-ttl=18h -audit-non-hmac-request-keys=common_name -audit-non-hmac-response-keys=serial_number pki/
Success! Tuned the secrets engine at: pki/

$ vault read sys/mounts/pki/tune
Key                             Value
---                             -----
audit_non_hmac_request_keys     [common_name]
audit_non_hmac_response_keys    [serial_number]
default_lease_ttl               18h
description                     Example PKI mount
force_no_cache                  false
max_lease_ttl                   24h
```

Specify multiple audit non-hmac request keys:

```shell-session
$ vault secrets tune -audit-non-hmac-request-keys=common_name -audit-non-hmac-request-keys=ttl pki/
```

## Usage

The following flags are available in addition to the [standard set of
flags](/vault/docs/commands) included on all commands.

- `-allowed-response-headers` `(string: "")` - response header values that the
  secrets engine will be allowed to set. Note that multiple keys may be
  specified by providing this option multiple times, each time with 1 key.

- `-audit-non-hmac-request-keys` `(string: "")` - Key that will not be HMAC'd
  by audit devices in the request data object. Note that multiple keys may be
  specified by providing this option multiple times, each time with 1 key.

- `-audit-non-hmac-response-keys` `(string: "")` - Key that will not be HMAC'd
  by audit devices in the response data object. Note that multiple keys may be
  specified by providing this option multiple times, each time with 1 key.

- `-default-lease-ttl` `(duration: "")` - The default lease TTL for this secrets
  engine. If unspecified, this defaults to the Vault server's globally
  configured default lease TTL, or a previously configured value for the secrets
  engine. Uses [duration format strings](/vault/docs/concepts/duration-format).

- `-description` `(string: "")` - Specifies the description of the mount.
  This overrides the current stored value, if any.

- `-listing-visibility` `(string: "")` - The flag to toggle whether to show the
  mount in the UI-specific listing endpoint. Valid values are `"unauth"` or `"hidden"`.
  Passing empty string leaves the current setting unchanged.

- `-max-lease-ttl` `(duration: "")` - The maximum lease TTL for this secrets
  engine. If unspecified, this defaults to the Vault server's globally
  configured [maximum lease TTL](/vault/docs/configuration#max_lease_ttl), or a
  previously configured value for the secrets engine. This value is allowed to
  override the server's global max TTL; it can be longer or shorter.
  Uses [duration format strings](/vault/docs/concepts/duration-format).

- `-passthrough-request-headers` `(string: "")` - request header values that will
  be sent to the secrets engine. Note that multiple keys may be
  specified by providing this option multiple times, each time with 1 key.

- `-allowed-managed-keys` `(string: "")` - Managed key name(s) that the mount
  in question is allowed to access. Note that multiple keys may be specified
  by providing this option multiple times, each time with 1 key.

- `-delegated-auth-accessors` `(string: "")` - An authorized accessor the auth
  backend can delegate authentication to. To allow multiple accessors, provide
  the `delegated-auth-accessors` multiple times, each time with 1 accessor.

- `-plugin-version` `(string: "")` - Configures the semantic version of the plugin
  to use. The new version will not start running until the mount is
  [reloaded](/vault/docs/commands/plugin/reload).
