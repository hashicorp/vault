# secrets disable

Disable a secrets engine at the given path.

<CodeBlockConfig hideClipboard>

```shell-session
$ vault secrets disable [flags] <path>

$ vault secrets disable [-help | -h]
```

</CodeBlockConfig>

## Description

`secrets disable` turns off a secrets engine at the path you specify. Make sure 
to use the engine's enabled path, not its type. When you disable an engine, 
Vault will:

- Revoke all secrets that the engine created
- Remove all of the engine's data from Vault

Keep in mind that disabling an engine with lots of secrets can put heavy load 
on your system, since Vault needs to revoke each secret.

### Force disable

If the revocation process fails, you might encounter errors that prevent you 
from disabling the secrets engine.

To fix this, first identify and resolve the underlying issue before trying to 
disable the engine again. Sometimes the solution may be increasing your timeout 
settings.

For emergency recovery (when you have manually removed secrets from the backing 
service), you can force Vault to disable the secrets engine. First run a 
[`prefix force revoke`](/vault/docs/commands/lease/revoke) on the mount prefix, 
then run `secrets disable`. If you haven't manually cleaned up the underlying 
secrets, you might end up with dangling credentials. This method is only 
recommended for extreme circumstances.
