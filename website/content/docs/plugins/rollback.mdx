# Rollback or downgrade Vault plugins

Downgrading a plugin in the catalog affects all uses of that plugin version.
Always check the plugin release notes for unsupported transitions before
starting your rollback or downgrade.


## Before you start

- **To register and downgrade enterprise plugins, you must have Vault v1.16.16+,
  1.17.12+, 1.18.5+, or 1.19.x+**.
- **You must have admin permissions for Vault**. Specifically, you must be able
  to run `plugin register` and the appropriate `enable` command.
- **You must have [`plugin_directory`](/vault/docs/configuration#plugin_directory)
  set in your Vault configuration file**.
- **You must have [`api_addr`](/vault/docs/configuration#api_addr) set in your
  Vault configuration file**.
- **If you plan to use a `.zip` file, the plugin must be compatible with the
  system running Vault**. Vault verifies plugin integrity and checks system
  compatibility during the registration process for extracted artifacts.

## Step 1: Prepare the plugin

@include 'plugins/prepare-plugin.mdx'


## Step 2: Update the plugin catalog

Register the replacement plugin binary or zip file with the old version number
under the same plugin type and name as the existing plugin version.

@include 'plugins/register.mdx'


## Step 3: Pin and reload the plugin

Until you reload the plugin, Vault continues running the current plugin version
on the mount path. When you trigger a reload, Vault kills the active plugin
process and start a new plugin process with the pinned version of that plugin.

@include 'plugins/pin-and-reload.mdx'


## Step 4: Verify the plugin status

@include 'plugins/verify-status.mdx'
