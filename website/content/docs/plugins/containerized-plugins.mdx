# Containerized plugins

@include 'alerts/beta.mdx'

<Note title="Limited OS support">

  Support for the `container` runtime is currently limited to Linux.

</Note>

By default, external plugins run as subprocesses that share Vault's user and
environment variables. Administrators managing Vault instances on Linux can
choose to run external plugins in containers. Running plugins in containers
increases the isolation between plugins, and between plugins and Vault.

## System requirements

- **Your Vault instance must be running on Linux**.

- **Your environment must provide Vault local access to the Docker Engine API**.
  Vault uses the [Docker SDK](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/docker/docker) to
  manage containerized plugins.

- **You must have a valid container runtime installed**. We recommend
  [installing gVisor](https://gvisor.dev/docs/user_guide/install/) for your
  container runtime as Vault specifies the `runsc` runtime by default.

- **You must have all your plugin container images pulled and available locally**.
  Vault does not currently support pulling images as part of the plugin
  registration process.

## Plugin requirements

All plugins have the following basic requirements to be containerized:

- **Your plugin must be built with at least v1.6.0 of the HashiCorp
  [`go-plugin`](https://github.com/hashicorp/go-plugin) library**.

- **The image entrypoint should run the plugin binary**.

Some configurations have additional requirements for the container image, listed
in [supported configurations](#supported-configurations).

## Supported configurations

Vault's containerized plugins are compatible with a variety of configurations.
In particular, it has been tested with the following:

- Default and [rootless](https://docs.docker.com/engine/security/rootless/) Docker.
- OCI-compatible runtimes `runsc` and `runc`.
- Plugin container images running as root and non-root users.
- [Mlock](/vault/docs/configuration#disable_mlock) disabled or enabled.

Not all combinations work and some have additional requirements, listed below.
If you use a configuration that matches multiple headings, you should combine
the requirements from each matching heading.

### `runsc` runtime

- You must pass an additional `--host-uds=create` flag to the `runsc` runtime.

### Rootless Docker with `runsc` runtime

- You must pass an additional `--ignore-cgroups` flag to the `runsc` runtime.
  - Cgroup limits are not currently supported for this configuration.

### Rootless Docker with non-root container user

- You must use a container plugin runtime with
  [`rootless`](/vault/docs/commands/plugin/runtime/register#rootless) enabled.
- Your filesystem must have Posix 1e ACL support, available by default in most
  modern Linux file systems.
- Only supported for gVisor's `runsc` runtime.

### Rootless Docker with mlock enabled

- Only supported for gVisor's `runsc` runtime.

### Non-root container user with mlock enabled

- You must set the `IPC_LOCK` capability on the plugin binary.

## Container lifecycle and metadata

Like any other external plugin, Vault will automatically manage the lifecycle
of plugin containers. If they are killed out of band, Vault will restart them
before servicing any requests that need to be handled by them. Vault will also
[multiplex](/vault/docs/plugins/plugin-architecture#plugin-multiplexing) multiple
mounts to be serviced by the same container if the plugin supports multiplexing.

Vault labels each plugin container with a standard set of metadata to help
identify the owner of the container, including the cluster ID, Vault's own
process ID, and the plugin's name, type, and version.

## Plugin runtimes

Users who require more control over plugin containers can use the "plugin
runtime" APIs for finer grained settings. See the CLI documentation for
[`vault plugin runtime`](/vault/docs/commands/plugin/runtime) for more details.
