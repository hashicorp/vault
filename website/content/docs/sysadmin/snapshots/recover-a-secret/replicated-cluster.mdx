# Recover to a replicated cluster

@include 'alerts/enterprise-only.mdx'

Recover and restore a discrete secret from an integrated storage snapshot to a
replicated cluster.

@include 'sysadmin/snapshots/disabled-mount-warning.mdx'


## Before you start 

@include 'sysadmin/snapshots/restore-requirements/load-snapshots.mdx'

@include 'sysadmin/snapshots/restore-requirements/restore-secrets.mdx'


## Step 1: Load a snapshot

Load the snapshot holding the secret you want to recover:

- For disaster recovery clusters, you must load snapshots on the primary cluster.

- For performance replication clusters, you can load snapshots on any cluster,
  but secondary clusters can only perform snapshot operations on paths that
  correspond to local mounts. You must use the primary performance node to peform
  snapshot operations on shared paths.

Status key | Description 
---------- | -----------
`loading`  | Vault is in the process of loading the snapshot
`ready`    | Loading completed successfully. You can read data from the snapshot.
`error`    | Loading failed. Refer to the logs and error details for troubleshooting.



## Step 2: Recover the secret

When the snapshot status is `ready`, you can recover the secret by specifying
the snapshot ID and the secret path you want to read from.

Vault reads the secret at the specified path from the snapshot and writes that
data to the associated path in Vault to recover the secret. The associated
plugin then creates or updates the data at the specified path in live cluster
storage.
