# Recover discrete data from a snapshot

@include 'alerts/enterprise-only.mdx'

Vault Enterprise features a flexible, robust, and delegatable recovery mechanism
for restoring deleted or mistakenly changed secrets from an integrated storage
snapshot without resetting the entire cluster to the state in the snapshot.

To recover a secret, you must load the associated snapshot into Vault so Vault
can access the data and assign a snapshot ID. Then you can use the snapshot ID
to read, list, and recover individual paths from the snapshot.

To recover the data, Vault reads the secret at the path from the snapshot to
retrieve that version of the data and sends it to the assocaited plugin backend
to perform the necessary recover operations. The plugin backend uses the
provided data and its own information to create or update data at the specified
path in live storage.

Vault automatically unloads snapshots 72 hours after they are loaded.



## Supported Paths

Not all secret paths support snapshot operations. Refer to the table below for
supported plugins and paths.

@include 'sysadmin/snapshots/restore-secret-support.mdx'


## Restoring secrets with replication

Secret restoration has limitations in replicated environments:

- If the active node changes, the loaded snapshot status changes to`error` and
  Vault cannot use it for recover operations. You must unload and reload the
  snapshot to use it again.
- Disaster recovery secondaries cannot load snapshots.
- Any performance replication cluster can load snapshots, but performance
  secondaries cannot perform snapshot operations on shared paths.



## Snapshot operations

You can read and list snapshot data using standard CLI and API calls, but you
must provide the relevant snapshot ID as an additional CLI parameter or API
query parameter. Vault performs the requested operation on the backend using the
loaded snapshot data instead of the live data.

For example, to list the secrets at a specific path from the snapshot:
```shell
$ vault list -snapshot-id <snapshot_id> <mount_path>/<secret_path>
```



## Policy requirements

Reading and listing from a snapshot are guarded by the same `read` and `list`
capabilities as the normal read and list operations. Users with `read` or `list`
permission on the targeted path can also read or list from a snapshot on that
path by default. However, to recover data from a snapshot, users must have
`recover` permission on the associated secret path. For example:

```hcl
path "secrets/*" {
  capabilities = ["recover"]
}
```

To disallow reading or listing from a snapshot, you can create a policy that
denies the `read_snapshot_id` parameter. For example, to disallow reading and
listing from a snapshot on the `secrets/*` path, you can create the policy:

```hcl
path "secrets/*" {
  capabilities = ["read", "list"]
  denied_parameters = {
    read_snapshot_id = []
  }
}
```
