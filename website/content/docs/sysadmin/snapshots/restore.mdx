# Restore a Vault snapshot

Manually restore data for a Vault cluster leader node with a saved snapshot.

## Before you start

- **You must a working knowledge of how Vault saves data**.
- **You must have a valid Vault cluster configuration using integratd storage**.
- **You must know, and be able to contact your unseal/recovery key holders**. In
  addition to the new root token generated during reinitalization, you need the
  original cluster unseal keys to unseal Vault after restoring the snapshot.
- **You must have permission to access encrypted data in backed storage**.


## Step 1: Bring your Vault cluster back online

Your Vault cluster must be online to restore a snapshot.

Resolve the circumstances that required you to restore from backup, reinitialize
your Vault cluster with new storage, and authenticate with the new initial root
token generated during re-initialization. The new root token is temporary as you
will overwrite the cluster state with the snapshot data.



## Step 2: Copy the snapshot file to the cluster

You must save your snapshot file as a local file on the cluster to restore the
data.

To restore a snapshot to a disaster recovery replication cluster, you must copy
your Vault snapshot files for the primary and DR replica clusters onto restored
members of the respective clusters.

To restore a snapshot to a performance replication cluster, you must copy
your Vault snapshot files for the primary and secondary performance replica
clusters onto restored members of the respective clusters.



## Step 3: Force a snapshot restore

You must use force the snapshot restore since the auto-unseal or Shamir keys are
not consistent with the snapshot data, which came from a different cluster.

Run
[`vault operator raft snapshot restore`](/vault/docs/commands/operator/raft#snapshot-restore)
with the local snapshot file path and the `-force` flag:

```shell-session
$ vault operator raft snapshot restore -force <local_file_path>
```

For example:
   
<CodeBlockConfig hideClipboard>
   
```shell-session
$ vault operator raft snapshot restore -force /tmp/snapshots/backup.snap
```
   
</CodeBlockConfig>

<Tab heading="API" group="api">

Call the
[`/v1/sys/storage/raft/snapshot-force`](/vault/api-docs/system/storage/raft#force-restore-raft-using-a-snapshot)
endpoint with the local snapshot file path:

```shell-session
$ curl                                       \
    --request POST                           \
    --header "X-Vault-Token: ${VAULT_TOKEN}" \
    --data-binary @<local_file_path>         \
    ${VAULT_ADDR}/v1/sys/storage/raft/snapshot-force
```

For example:

<CodeBlockConfig hideClipboard>

```shell-session
$ curl                                       \
    --request POST                           \
    --header "X-Vault-Token: ${VAULT_TOKEN}" \
    --data-binary /tmp/snapshots/backup.snap \
    ${VAULT_ADDR}/v1/sys/storage/raft/snapshot-force
```

</CodeBlockConfig>

## Step 4: Unseal Vault

<Tabs>

<Tab heading="CLI" group="cli">

Run
[`vault operator raft snapshot restore`](/vault/docs/commands/operator/raft#snapshot-restore)
with the local snapshot file path and the `-force` flag:

```shell-session
$ vault operator raft snapshot restore -force <local_file_path>
```

For example:
   
<CodeBlockConfig hideClipboard>
   
```shell-session
$ vault operator raft snapshot restore -force /tmp/snapshots/backup.snap
```

</CodeBlockConfig>
   
You must use the `-force` flag as the auto-unseal or Shamir keys are not
consistent with the snapshot data, which came from a different cluster.

Have each person with an unseal key share run
[`v1/sys/unseal`](/vault/api-docs/system/unseal) with their original unseal
key until reaching the number of key shares required by your origial quroum
configuration to unseal your Vault cluster:
   
```shell-session
$ curl                                       \
   --request POST                            \
   --header "X-Vault-Token: ${VAULT_TOKEN}"  \
   --data '{"key": "<unseal_key>"}'          \
   ${VAULT_ADDR}/v1/sys/unseal
