# Save a Vault snapshot

Manually back up data from your Vault cluster leader node with a snapshot.

<Tip>

If you are taking snapshots as preparation for a Vault Enterprise upgrade,
review the
[Automate upgrades with Vault Enterprise](/vault/tutorials/raft/raft-upgrade-automation)
tutorial to learn how you can automate your upgrades with autopilot.

</Tip>


## Before you start

- **You must a working knowledge of how Vault saves data**.
- **You must have a valid Vault cluster configuration using integratd storage**.
- **You must know, and be able to contact your unseal/recovery key holders**.
- **You must have permission to access encrypted data in backed storage**.
- **You should have a secure location, away from your Vault cluster
  infrastructure, to save the snapshot file**.


## Save a single cluster snapshot

Take a snapshot of a single Vault cluster.


<Tabs>

<Tab heading="CLI" group="cli">

Use the Vault CLI to take a snapshot from the cluster members with a command like this example.

```shell-session
$ vault operator raft snapshot save backup.snap
```

This command writes a snapshot to the local file `backup.snap`.

Learn more in the [snapshot CLI documentation](/vault/docs/commands/operator/raft#snapshot).

</Tab>

<Tab heading="API" group="api">

Use cURL with the Vault API to take a snapshot from the cluster members with a command like this example.

```shell-session
$ curl \
    --header "X-Vault-Token: ..." \
    --request GET \
    https://127.0.0.1:8200/v1/sys/storage/raft/snapshot > backup.snap
```

This command writes a snapshot to the local file `backup.snap`.

## Save a DR replication cluster snapshot

Take a snapshot of a cluster participating in disater recovery replication.

<Tabs>

<Tab heading="CLI" group="cli">

Take snapshots from the cluster members on the DR Primary cluster using a command like this example.

```shell-session
$ vault operator raft snapshot save primary.snap
```

This command writes a snapshot to the local file `primary.snap`.

## Save a performance replication (PR) cluster snapshot

Take a manual snapshot of a cluster participating in performance replication.

<Tabs>

<Tab heading="CLI" group="cli">

Take separate snapshots from the Vault Integrated Storage (Raft) cluster members
supporting both the Performance Primary cluster and Performance Secondary
cluster using commands like these examples.

First, take a snapshot on the primary cluster.

```shell-session
$ vault operator raft snapshot save primary.snap
```

This command writes a snapshot to the local file `primary.snap`.

Next, take a snapshot on the secondary cluster.

```shell-session
$ vault operator raft snapshot save secondary.snap
```

This command writes a snapshot to the local file `secondary.snap`.
