# OIDC auth method

@include 'x509-sha1-deprecation.mdx'

The `oidc` auth method can be used to authenticate with Vault using OpenID Connect
([OIDC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenID_Connect)). This allows human users to
authenticate with Vault using their identity in an OIDC Identity Provider.

The OIDC auth method allows authentication via a configured OIDC provider using the user's
web browser. This method may be initiated from the Vault UI or the command line. Basic
familiarity with [OIDC concepts](https://developer.okta.com/blog/2017/07/25/oidc-primer-part-1)
is assumed. The Authorization Code flow makes use of the Proof Key for Code Exchange
([PKCE](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7636)) extension.

## Authentication

Vault includes two built-in OIDC login flows: the Vault UI, and the CLI
using a `vault login`.

### OIDC login (Vault UI)

1. Select the "OIDC" login method.
1. Enter a role name if necessary.
1. Press "Sign In" and complete the authentication with the configured provider.

### OIDC login (CLI)

The CLI login defaults to path of `/oidc`. If this auth method was enabled at a
different path, specify `-path=/my-path` in the CLI.

```shell-session
$ vault login -method=oidc port=8400 role=test

Complete the login via your OIDC provider. Launching browser to:

    https://myco.auth0.com/authorize?redirect_uri=http%3A%2F%2Flocalhost%3A8400%2Foidc%2Fcallback&client_id=r3qXc2bix9eF...
```

The browser will open to the generated URL to complete the provider's login. The
URL may be entered manually if the browser cannot be automatically opened.

- `skip_browser` (default: "false"). Toggle the automatic launching of the default browser to the login URL.

The callback listener may be customized with the following optional parameters. These are typically
not required to be set:

- `mount` (default: "oidc")
- `listenaddress` (default: "localhost")
- `port` (default: 8250)
- `callbackhost` (default: "localhost")
- `callbackmethod` (default: "http")
- `callbackport` (default: value set for `port`). This value is used in the `redirect_uri`, whereas
  `port` is the localhost port that the listener is using. These two may be different in advanced setups.

## Configuration

The OIDC authentication flow has been successfully tested with a number of providers. A full
guide to configuring OAuth/OIDC applications is beyond the scope of Vault documentation, but a
collection of provider configuration steps has been collected to help get started:
[OIDC Provider Setup](/vault/docs/auth/oidc/oidc-providers)

### Redirect URIs

An important part of OIDC role configuration is properly setting redirect URIs. This must be
done both in Vault and with the OIDC provider, and these configurations must align. The
redirect URIs are specified for a role with the `allowed_redirect_uris` parameter. There are
different redirect URIs to configure the Vault UI and CLI flows, so one or both will need to
be set up depending on the installation.

**CLI**

If you plan to support authentication via `vault login -method=oidc`, a localhost redirect URI
must be set. This can usually be: `http://localhost:8250/oidc/callback`. Logins via the CLI may
specify a different host and/or listening port if needed, and a URI with this host/port must match one
of the configured redirected URIs. These same "localhost" URIs must be added to the provider as well.

**Vault UI**

Logging in via the Vault UI requires a redirect URI of the form:

`https://{host:port}/ui/vault/auth/{path}/oidc/callback`

The "host:port" must be correct for the Vault server, and "path" must match the path the OIDC
backend is mounted at.

If the [oidc_response_mode](/vault/api-docs/auth/jwt#oidc_response_mode) is set to `form_post`, then
logging in via the Vault UI requires a redirect URI of the form:

`https://{host:port}/v1/auth/{path}/oidc/callback`

Prior to Vault 1.6, if [namespaces](/vault/docs/enterprise/namespaces) are in use,
they must be added as query parameters, for example:

`https://vault.example.com:8200/ui/vault/auth/oidc/oidc/callback?namespace=my_ns`

For Vault 1.6+, it is no longer necessary to add the namespace as a query
parameter in the redirect URI, if
[`namespace_in_state`](/vault/api-docs/auth/jwt#namespace_in_state) is set to `true`,
which is the default for new configs.

### OIDC configuration troubleshooting

This amount of configuration required for OIDC is relatively small, but it can be tricky to debug
why things aren't working. Some tips for setting up OIDC:

- If a role parameter (e.g. `bound_claims`) requires a map value, it can't be set individually using
  the Vault CLI. In these cases the best approach is to write the entire configuration as a single
  JSON object:

```text
vault write auth/oidc/role/demo -<<EOF
{
  "user_claim": "sub",
  "bound_audiences": "abc123",
  "role_type": "oidc",
  "policies": "demo",
  "ttl": "1h",
  "bound_claims": { "groups": ["mygroup/mysubgroup"] }
}
EOF
```

- Monitor Vault's log output. Important information about OIDC validation failures will be emitted.

- Ensure Redirect URIs are correct in Vault and on the provider. They need to match exactly. Check:
  http/https, 127.0.0.1/localhost, port numbers, whether trailing slashes are present.

- Start simple. The only claim configuration a role requires is `user_claim`. After authentication is
  known to work, you can add additional claims bindings and metadata copying.

- `bound_audiences` is optional for OIDC roles and typically not required. OIDC providers will use
  the client_id as the audience and OIDC validation expects this.

- Check your provider for what scopes are required in order to receive all
  of the information you need. The scopes "profile" and "groups" often need to be
  requested, and can be added by setting `oidc_scopes="profile,groups"` on the role.

- If you're seeing claim-related errors in logs, review the provider's docs very carefully to see
  how they're naming and structuring their claims. Depending on the provider, you may be able to
  construct a simple `curl` implicit grant request to obtain a JWT that you can inspect. An example
  of how to decode the JWT (in this case located in the "access_token" field of a JSON response):

  `cat jwt.json | jq -r .access_token | cut -d. -f2 | base64 -D`

- As of Vault 1.2, the [`verbose_oidc_logging`](/vault/api-docs/auth/jwt#verbose_oidc_logging) role
  option is available which will log the received OIDC token to the _server_ logs if debug-level logging is enabled. This can
  be helpful when debugging provider setup and verifying that the received claims are what you expect.
  Since claims data is logged verbatim and may contain sensitive information, this option should not be
  used in production.

- Azure requires some additional configuration when a user is a member of more
  than 200 groups, described in [Azure-specific handling
  configuration](/vault/docs/auth/oidc/oidc-providers/azuread#optional-azure-specific-configuration)
