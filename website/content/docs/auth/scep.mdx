# SCEP auth method


@include 'alerts/enterprise-only.mdx'

The SCEP authentication method controls static challenges and Intune
authentication methods for clients using the SCEP protocol within given PKI
mounts.

## Authentication

Do not use the SCEP plugin directly. SCEP mount paths only support 
[delegated authentication](/vault/api-docs/system/mounts#delegated_auth_accessors)
from a PKI mount.

Multiple PKI mounts can use the same SCEP authN mount. If you configure a PKI
mount without an associated SCEP role, Vault returns the first matching SCEP
role that meets the other request criteria.

PKI mounts configured for Intune only match SCEP auth roles with `intune` set as
the authentication type. All other PKI mounts can match to SCEP auth roles with
`static-challenge` set as the authentication type.

## Configuration

Configure the SCEP authentication method through roles. Within each SCEP role,
specify the authentiation type with `auth_type` to indicate whether your SCEP
mount uses static challenge authentication or Intune authentication.

`auth_type`        | Authentication
------------------ | --------------
`static-challenge` | Method specified in `challenge` parameter
`intune`           | Intune authentication

When the authentication methods repeast across multiple roles, You must
configure your PKI mounts with the prefered SCEP role name to match with the
appropriate role. If you leave the role name unset, the SCEP mount returns the
first matching role, which might not have the correct policy attached to it.

## API

The SCEP auth method has a full HTTP API. Refer to the [SCEP auth API documentation](/vault/api-docs/auth/scep) for more details.
