# SCEP auth method

The SCEP auth method is an enterprise-only feature that allows control of static challenges and Intune authentication
methods for clients using the SCEP protocol within given PKI mounts.

## Authentication

This auth mount isn't to be used directly, but rather through
[delegated authentication](/vault/api-docs/system/mounts#delegated_auth_accessors) from a PKI mount.

Multiple PKI mounts can use the same SCEP auth mount, if the SCEP role name is not provided within the PKI mount's
configuration, the first matching SCEP role will be based on matching criteria. If a PKI mount has configured an InTune
integration, it will only match SCEP auth roles with `intune` set as the `auth_type`, otherwise it will attempt to match
the SCEP auth roles with `static-challenge` set as the `auth_type`.

## Configuration

The SCEP auth method is configured through roles. Within each SCEP role, the `auth_type` specifies if the role
is using static challenge authentication or Intune authentication.

### Static challenge authentication type

Within the SCEP role, if the `auth_type` is set to `static-challenge`, the SCEP role will allow usage of the challenge value
specified within the role's `challenge` field.

If the challenge value is repeated across multiple roles, the PKI mount will need to specify the scep role name
within it's configuration to match the appropriate role, otherwise the first matching role will be used,
which might not have the correct policy attached to it.

### Intune authentication type

If the SCEP role has a value of `intune` for the `auth_type`, the SCEP role will allow usage of InTune authentication
if the PKI mount is requesting it.

If multiple roles are configured with the `intune` authentication type, the PKI mount
will need to specify the scep role name within it's configuration to match the appropriate role, otherwise the first
matching role will be used, which might not have the correct policy attached to it.

## API

The SCEP auth method has a full HTTP API. Please see the [SCEP auth API](/vault/api-docs/auth/scep) for more details.
