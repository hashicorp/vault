## Kubernetes

Kubernetes can function as an OIDC provider such that Vault can validate its
service account tokens using JWT/OIDC auth.

-> **Note:** The JWT auth engine does **not** use Kubernetes' `TokenReview` API
during authentication, and instead uses public key cryptography to verify the
contents of JWTs. This means tokens that have been revoked by Kubernetes will
still be considered valid by Vault until their expiry time. To mitigate this
risk, use short TTLs for service account tokens or use
[Kubernetes auth](/vault/docs/auth/kubernetes) which _does_ use the `TokenReview` API.

### Using service account issuer discovery

When using service account issuer discovery, you only need to provide the JWT
auth mount with an OIDC discovery URL, and sometimes a TLS certificate authority
to trust. This makes it the most straightforward method to configure if your
Kubernetes cluster meets the requirements.

Kubernetes cluster requirements:

* [`ServiceAccountIssuerDiscovery`][k8s-sa-issuer-discovery] feature enabled.
  * Present from 1.18, defaults to enabled from 1.20.
* kube-apiserver's `--service-account-issuer` flag is set to a URL that is
  reachable from Vault. Public by default for most managed Kubernetes solutions.
* Must use short-lived service account tokens when logging in.
  * Tokens mounted into pods default to short-lived from 1.21.

Configuration steps:

1. Ensure OIDC discovery URLs do not require authentication, as detailed
   [here][k8s-sa-issuer-discovery]:

   ```bash
   kubectl create clusterrolebinding oidc-reviewer  \
      --clusterrole=system:service-account-issuer-discovery \
      --group=system:unauthenticated
   ```

1. Find the issuer URL of the cluster.

   ```bash
   ISSUER="$(kubectl get --raw /.well-known/openid-configuration | jq -r '.issuer')"
   ```

1. Enable and configure JWT auth in Vault.

  1. If Vault is running in Kubernetes:

     ```bash
     kubectl exec vault-0 -- vault auth enable jwt
     kubectl exec vault-0 -- vault write auth/jwt/config \
        oidc_discovery_url=https://kubernetes.default.svc.cluster.local \
        oidc_discovery_ca_pem=@/var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount/ca.crt
     ```

  1. Alternatively, if Vault is _not_ running in Kubernetes:

     -> **Note:** When Vault is outside the cluster, the `$ISSUER` endpoint below may
     or may not be reachable. If not, you can configure JWT auth using
     [`jwt_validation_pubkeys`](#using-jwt-validation-public-keys) instead.

     ```bash
     vault auth enable jwt
     vault write auth/jwt/config oidc_discovery_url="${ISSUER}"
     ```

1. Configure a role and log in as detailed [below](#creating-a-role-and-logging-in).

[k8s-sa-issuer-discovery]: https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-service-account/#service-account-issuer-discovery

### Using JWT validation public keys

This method can be useful if Kubernetes' API is not reachable from Vault or if
you would like a single JWT auth mount to service multiple Kubernetes clusters
by chaining their public signing keys.

<Note title="Rotation of the JWT Signing Key in Kubernetes">
  Should the JWT Signing Key used by Kubernetes be rotated,
  this process should be repeated with the new key.
</Note>

Kubernetes cluster requirements:

* [`ServiceAccountIssuerDiscovery`][k8s-sa-issuer-discovery] feature enabled.
  * Present from 1.18, defaults to enabled from 1.20.
  * This requirement can be avoided if you can access the Kubernetes master
    nodes to read the public signing key directly from disk at
    `/etc/kubernetes/pki/sa.pub`. In this case, you can skip the steps to
    retrieve and then convert the key as it will already be in PEM format.
* Must use short-lived service account tokens when logging in.
  * Tokens mounted into pods default to short-lived from 1.21.

Configuration steps:

1. Fetch the service account signing public key from your cluster's JWKS URI.

   ```bash
   # Query the jwks_uri specified in /.well-known/openid-configuration
   kubectl get --raw "$(kubectl get --raw /.well-known/openid-configuration | jq -r '.jwks_uri' | sed -r 's/.*\.[^/]+(.*)/\1/')"
   ```

1. Convert the keys from JWK format to PEM. You can use a CLI tool or an online
   converter such as [this one][jwk-to-pem].

1. Configure the JWT auth mount with those public keys.

   ```bash
   vault write auth/jwt/config \
      jwt_validation_pubkeys="-----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----
   MIIBIjANBgkqhkiG9...
   -----END PUBLIC KEY-----","-----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----
   MIIBIjANBgkqhkiG9...
   -----END PUBLIC KEY-----"
   ```

1. Configure a role and log in as detailed [below](#creating-a-role-and-logging-in).

### Creating a role and logging in

Once your JWT auth mount is configured, you're ready to configure a role and
log in. The following assumes you use the projected service account token
available in all pods by default. See [Specifying TTL and audience](#specifying-ttl-and-audience)
below if you'd like to control the audience or TTL.

1. Choose any value from the array of default audiences. In these examples,
   there is only one audience in the `aud` array,
   `https://kubernetes.default.svc.cluster.local`.

   To find the default audiences, either create a fresh token (requires
   `kubectl` v1.24.0+):

   ```shell-session
   $ kubectl create token default | cut -f2 -d. | base64 --decode
   {"aud":["https://kubernetes.default.svc.cluster.local"], ... "sub":"system:serviceaccount:default:default"}
   ```

   Or read a token from a running pod's filesystem:

   ```shell-session
   $ kubectl exec my-pod -- cat /var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount/token | cut -f2 -d. | base64 --decode
   {"aud":["https://kubernetes.default.svc.cluster.local"], ... "sub":"system:serviceaccount:default:default"}
   ```

1. Create a role for JWT auth that the `default` service account from the
   `default` namespace can use.

   ```bash
   vault write auth/jwt/role/my-role \
      role_type="jwt" \
      bound_audiences="<AUDIENCE-FROM-PREVIOUS-STEP>" \
      user_claim="sub" \
      bound_subject="system:serviceaccount:default:default" \
      policies="default" \
      ttl="1h"
   ```

1. Pods or other clients with access to a service account JWT can then log in.

   ```bash
   vault write auth/jwt/login \
      role=my-role \
      jwt=@/var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount/token
   # OR equivalent to:
   curl \
      --fail \
      --request POST \
      --header "X-Vault-Request: true" \
      --data '{"jwt":"<JWT-TOKEN-HERE>","role":"my-role"}' \
      "${VAULT_ADDR}/v1/auth/jwt/login"
   ```

### Specifying TTL and audience

If you would like to specify a custom TTL or audience for service account tokens,
the following pod spec illustrates a volume mount that overrides the default
admission injected token. This is especially relevant if you are unable to
disable the [--service-account-extend-token-expiration][k8s-extended-tokens]
flag for `kube-apiserver` and want to use short TTLs.

When using the resulting token, you will need to set `bound_audiences=vault`
when creating roles in Vault's JWT auth mount.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: nginx
spec:
  # automountServiceAccountToken is redundant in this example because the
  # mountPath used overlaps with the default path. The overlap stops the default
  # admission injected token from being created. You can use this option to
  # ensure only a single token is mounted if you choose a different mount path.
  automountServiceAccountToken: false
  containers:
    - name: nginx
      image: nginx
      volumeMounts:
      - name: custom-token
        mountPath: /var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount
  volumes:
  - name: custom-token
    projected:
      defaultMode: 420
      sources:
      - serviceAccountToken:
          path: token
          expirationSeconds: 600 # 10 minutes is the minimum TTL
          audience: vault        # Must match your JWT role's `bound_audiences`
      # The remaining sources are included to mimic the rest of the default
      # admission injected volume.
      - configMap:
          name: kube-root-ca.crt
          items:
          - key: ca.crt
            path: ca.crt
      - downwardAPI:
          items:
          - fieldRef:
              apiVersion: v1
              fieldPath: metadata.namespace
            path: namespace
```
