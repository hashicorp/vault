# OIDC provider configuration

This page collects high-level setup steps on how to configure an OIDC
application for various providers. For more general usage and operation
information, see the [Vault JWT/OIDC method documentation](/vault/docs/auth/jwt).

OIDC providers are often highly configurable, and you should become familiar with
their recommended settings and best practices. The guides listed below are
largely community-driven and intended to help you get started. Corrections
and additions may be submitted via the [Vault Github repository](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault).
