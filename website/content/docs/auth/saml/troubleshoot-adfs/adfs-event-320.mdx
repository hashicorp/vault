# AD FS event 320

Troubleshoot problems where your AD FS event logs show error 320.



## Example debugging data

AD FS event log shows the following error:

<CodeBlockConfig hideClipboard highlight="1,4">

```shell-session
The verification of the SAML message signature failed.
Message issuer: MyVaultIdentifier
Exception details:
MSIS7086: The relying party trust 'MyVaultIdentifier' indicates that authentication requests sent by this relying party will be signed but no signature is present.
```

</CodeBlockConfig>



## Analysis

Verify that `SignedSamlRequestsRequired` is `false` for your AD FS Relying Party
Trust for Vault:

```powershell
Get-AdfsRelyingPartyTrust -Name "<ADFS_VAULT_POLICY_NAME>"
```

For example:

<CodeBlockConfig hideClipboard>

```powershell
Get-AdfsRelyingPartyTrust -Name "Vault"
```

</CodeBlockConfig>



## Solution

Set `SignedSamlRequestsRequired` to `false`:

```powershell
$ Set-AdfsRelyingPartyTrust                 `
    -TargetName "<ADFS_VAULT_POLICY_NAME>"  `
    -SignedSamlRequestsRequired $false
```

For example:

<CodeBlockConfig hideClipboard>

```powershell
$ Set-AdfsRelyingPartyTrust `
    -TargetName "Vault"     `
    -SignedSamlRequestsRequired $false
```

</CodeBlockConfig>
