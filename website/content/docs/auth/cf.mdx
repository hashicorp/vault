# Cloud Foundry (CF) Auth Method

@include 'x509-sha1-deprecation.mdx'

The `cf` auth method provides an automated mechanism to retrieve a Vault token
for CF instances. It leverages CF's [App and Container Identity Assurance](https://content.pivotal.io/blog/new-in-pcf-2-1-app-container-identity-assurance-via-automatic-cert-rotation).
At a high level, this works as follows:

1. You construct a request to Vault including your `CF_INSTANCE_CERT`, signed by your `CF_INSTANCE_KEY`.
2. Vault validates that the signature is no more than 300 seconds old, or 60 seconds in the future.
3. Vault validates that the cert was issued by the CA certificate you've pre-configured.
4. Vault validates that the request was signed by the private key for the `CF_INSTANCE_CERT`.
5. Vault validates that the `CF_INSTANCE_CERT` application ID, space ID, and org ID presently exist.
6. If all checks pass, Vault issues an appropriately-scoped token.

## Known Risks

This authentication engine uses CF's instance identity service to authenticate users to Vault. Because
CF makes its CA certificate and private key available to certain users at any time, it's possible for
someone with access to them to self-issue identity certificates that meet the criteria for a Vault role,
allowing them to gain unintended access to Vault.

For this reason, we recommend that if you enable this auth method, you carefully guard access to the
private key for your instance identity CA certificate. In CredHub, it can be obtained through the
following call: `$ credhub get -n /cf/diego-instance-identity-root-ca`.

Take extra steps to limit access to that path in CredHub, whether it be through use of CredHub's ACL
system, or through carefully limiting the users who can access CredHub.

## Usage

### Preparing to Configure the Plugin

To configure this plugin, you'll need to gather the CA certificate that CF uses to issue each `CF_INSTANCE_CERT`,
and you'll need to configure it to access the CF API.

To gain your instance identity CA certificate, in the [cf dev](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/cfdev)
environment it can be found using:

```shell-session
$ bosh int --path /diego_instance_identity_ca ~/.cfdev/state/bosh/creds.yml
```

In environments containing Ops Manager, it can be found in CredHub. To gain access to CredHub, first install
[the PCF command-line utility](https://docs.pivotal.io/tiledev/2-2/pcf-command.html) and authenticate to it
using the `metadata` file it describes. These instructions also use [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/) for
ease of drilling into the particular part of the response you'll need.

Once those steps are complete, get the credentials you'll use for CredHub:

```shell-session
$ pcf settings | jq '.products[0].director_credhub_client_credentials'
```

SSH into your Ops Manager VM:

```shell-session
$ ssh -i ops_mgr.pem ubuntu@$OPS_MGR_URL
```

Please note that the above OPS_MGR_URL shouldn't be prepended with `https://`.

Log into CredHub with the credentials you obtained earlier:

```shell-session
$ credhub login --client-name=director_to_credhub --client-secret=some-secret
```

And view the root certificate CF uses to issue instance identity certificates:

```shell-session
$ credhub get -n /cf/diego-instance-identity-root-ca
```

The output to that call will include two certificates and one RSA key. You will need to copy the certificate
under `ca: |` and place it into a file on your local machine that's properly formatted. Here's an example of
a properly formatted CA certificate:

```shell-session
$ cat ca.crt

An easy way to verify that your CA certificate is properly formatted is using OpenSSL like so:

```shell-session
$ openssl x509 -in ca.crt -text -noout

You will also need to configure access to the CF API. To prepare for this, we will now
use the [cf](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/cf-cli/install-go-cli.html) command-line tool.

First, while in the directory containing the `metadata` file you used earlier to authenticate
to CF, run `$ pcf target`. This points the `cf` tool at the same place as the `pcf` tool. Next,
run `$ cf api` to view the API endpoint that Vault will use.

Next, configure a user for Vault to use. This plugin was tested with Org Manager level
permissions, but lower level permissions _may_ be usable.

```shell-session
$ cf create-user vault pa55w0rd
$ cf orgs
$ cf org-users my-example-org
$ cf set-org-role vault my-example-org OrgManager
```

Specifically, the `vault` user created here will need to be able to perform the following API calls:

- Method: "GET", endpoint: "/v2/info"
- Method: "POST", endpoint: "/oauth/token"
- Method: "GET", endpoint: "/v2/apps/\$APP_ID"
- Method: "GET", endpoint: "/v2/organizations/\$ORG_ID"
- Method: "GET", endpoint: "/v2/spaces/\$SPACE_ID"

Next, PCF often uses a self-signed certificate for TLS, which can be rejected at first
with an error like:

```
x509: certificate signed by unknown authority
```

If you encounter this error, you will need to first gain a copy of the certificate that CF
is using for the API via:

```shell-session
$ openssl s_client -showcerts -servername domain.com -connect domain.com:443
```

Here is an example of a real call:

```shell-session
$ openssl s_client -showcerts -servername api.sys.somewhere.cf-app.com -connect api.sys.somewhere.cf-app.com:443
```

Part of the response will contain a certificate, which you'll need to copy and paste to
a well-formatted local file. Please see `ca.crt` above for an example of how the certificate
should look, and how to verify it can be parsed using `openssl`. The walkthrough below presumes
you name this file `cfapi.crt`.

### Walkthrough

After obtaining the information described above, a Vault operator will configure the CF auth method
like so:

```shell-session
$ vault auth enable cf

$ vault write auth/cf/config \
      identity_ca_certificates=@ca.crt \
      cf_api_addr=https://api.dev.cfdev.sh \
      cf_username=vault \
      cf_password=pa55w0rd \
      cf_api_trusted_certificates=@cfapi.crt

$ vault write auth/cf/roles/my-role \
    bound_application_ids=2d3e834a-3a25-4591-974c-fa5626d5d0a1 \
    bound_space_ids=3d2eba6b-ef19-44d5-91dd-1975b0db5cc9 \
    bound_organization_ids=34a878d0-c2f9-4521-ba73-a9f664e82c7bf \
    policies=my-policy
```

Once configured, from a CF instance containing real values for the `CF_INSTANCE_CERT` and
`CF_INSTANCE_KEY`, login can be performed using:

```shell-session
$ vault login -method=cf role=test-role
```

For CF, we do also offer an agent that, once configured, can be used to obtain a Vault token on
your behalf.

### Maintenance

In testing we found that CF instance identity CA certificates were set to expire in 3 years. Some
CF docs indicate they expire every 4 years. However long they last, at some point you may need
to add another CA certificate - one that's soon to expire, and one that is currently or soon-to-be
valid.

```shell-session
$ CURRENT=$(cat /path/to/current-ca.crt)
$ FUTURE=$(cat /path/to/future-ca.crt)
$ vault write auth/vault-plugin-auth-cf/config identity_ca_certificates="$CURRENT" identity_ca_certificates="$FUTURE"
```

If Vault receives a `CF_INSTANCE_CERT` matching _any_ of the `identity_ca_certificates`,
the instance cert will be considered valid.

A similar approach can be taken to update the `cf_api_trusted_certificates`.

### Troubleshooting At-A-Glance

If you receive an error containing `x509: certificate signed by unknown authority`, set
`cf_api_trusted_certificates` as described above.

If you're unable to authenticate using the `CF_INSTANCE_CERT`, first obtain a current copy
of your `CF_INSTANCE_CERT` and copy it to your local environment. Then divide it into two
files, each being a distinct certificate. The first certificate tends to be the actual
`identity.crt`, and the second one tends to be the `intermediate.crt`. Verify each are
properly named and formatted using a command like:

```shell-session
$ openssl x509 -in ca.crt -text -noout
```

Then, verify that the certificates are properly chained to the `ca.crt` you've configured:

```shell-session
$ openssl verify -CAfile ca.crt -untrusted intermediate.crt identity.crt
```

This should show a success response. If it doesn't, try to identify the root cause, be it
an expired certificate, an incorrect `ca.crt`, or a Vault configuration that doesn't
match the certificates you're checking.

## API

The CF auth method has a full HTTP API. Please see the [CF Auth API](/api-docs/auth/cf)
for more details.
