# Rollback a Vault upgrade

Vault supports in-place upgrades but does not support automatic rollbacks.

## Before you start

- **You must have `sudo` permissions on the Vault server**. Make sure you have
  can install binaries on the Vault server.
- **You must have admin permissions for Vault**. Make sure you can stop and 
  start the Vault process.
- **Identify unseal candidates**. Identify and notify enough people with unseal
  shards to meet the unseal threshold after restart.
