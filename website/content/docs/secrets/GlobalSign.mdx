# GlobalSign Atlas Secret Engine

The GlobalSign Atlas secret engine generates, issues, and manages certificates
dynamically in your ATLAS account. This simplifies certificate issuance
and life cycle management since the engine can manage key generation and life cycle. Additionally
this enables codifying and mapping issuance policy to internal authentication methods, such as
public cloud credentials or SSO solutions.

# Setup

Most secrets engines must be configured in advance before they can perform their
functions. These steps are usually completed by an operator or configuration
management tool.

This documentation assumes you have already registered the [Atlas plugin](https://github.com/globalsign/atlas-hashicorp-vault) with your Vault instance.
If you have not, please download the [latest release](https://github.com/globalsign/atlas-hashicorp-vault/releases) and follow [vault's plugin registration instructions](https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/internals/plugins#plugin-registration).
 
**_(Note: We have automated most of these plugin registration steps and user can directly navigate to_** `atlas-hashicorp-vault` **_and run_** `make`**_. This will register the plugin and start server)_**

1.  Enable the GlobalSign Atlas secrets engine:

    ```bash
    $ vault secrets enable atlas
    Success! Enabled the atlas secrets engine at: atlas/
    ```

    By default, the secrets engine will mount at the name of the engine. To
    enable the secrets engine at a different path, use the `-path` argument.

2.  Configure the credentials that Vault uses to communicate with Atlas to issue and
    manage certificates:

    ```bash
    $ vault write atlas/config/authn \
        api_key=<Your_Atlas_API_Key>
        api_secret=<Your_Atlas_API_Secret>
        api_cert=$(base64 --wrap=0 < ./your_atlas_client_certificate.pem)
        api_cert_key=$(base64 --wrap=0 < ./your_atlas_client_certificate_key.pem)
    ```

    Internally, Vault will connect to GlobalSign Atlas using these credentials.

    ~> **Notice:** Your client certificate should be provided as a base64 encoded PEM certificate and PEM private key.
        You can acquire the certificate from your account manager.
    ~> **Notice:** If you are getting PEM not recognized errors, you may need to add the `--wrap=0` flag to your base64 commands.

3.  Configure a Vault role that maps to a set of permissions.
    ```bash
    $ vault write atlas/roles/my-role allow_any_name=true enforce_hostnames=false
    ```

    This creates a role named "my-role". When users generate certificates against
    this role, Vault will validate the certificate request against the permissions.
    Vault then send the certificate request to be issued by your Atlas instance.

    Since the above role constraints are permissive, we  recommend tighter rules to fit your use case. Note that your Atlas account
    policy will also apply to issued certificates, and only certificates that meet both local and Alas policies will be issued.


4.  Issue a Certificate through Vault using your role
    ```bash
    $ vault write atlas/issue/my-role common_name="example.com" ttl=24h
    ```

    This creates a Private Key and a Certificate using the provided role and certificate configuration. You can reference this
    certificate in future requests using the serial number returned in the response.

    It's important to safely store your private key since you will not be able to retrieve it in future requests.

5.  Sign a CSR through Vault using your role
    ```bash
    $ vault write atlas/sign/my-role csr="$(cat my_signing_request.csr)" ttl=48h
    ```

    This will evaluate your signing request and other options against your local role and Atlas account policy, if successful it will
    return a signed certificate and serial number for future reference.

6. List Your Certificates
    ```bash
    $ vault list atlas/certs
    ```

    This returns a list of certificate serial numbers that have been issued through this Vault cluster. This can be used for
    getting more details or revoking certificates.

7. Get Details on a Certificate
    ```bash
    $ vault read atlas/cert/00-00-00-00-00-00-00-...
    ```

    This will give you the certificate pem and other issuance metadata, and you can retrieve the serial number from the certificate itself if
    you would like to reverse this, but you must separate hex pairs with `-`.

    Note that you can only get details on certificates issued through this Vault cluster. Once a certificate is expired
    or revoked, it will remain visible here for a short duration.


8. Revoking a Certificate
    ```bash
    $ vault write atlas/revoke serial_number=00-00-00-00-00-00-00-...
    ```

    Just like Get details this requires a `-` separated serial number. This will have your Atlas account add the certificate to
    relevant revocation lists, and update its status within the Vault cluster.

    If you are revoking lots of certificates, it's a good idea to invoke `tidy`, which will clean up excess metadata within Vault.

    ```bash
    $ vault write atlas/tidy
    ```


## Usage

## Troubleshooting

If you get stuck at any time, simply run `vault path-help atlas` or with a subpath for
interactive help output.

### Not Authenticated Error

If you are seeing unauthenticated errors from Atlas, you may need to update the credentials stored in Atlas. You can do this by calling the `config/authn` endpoint.

### Unable to Find Certificate Issued Outside of Vault

The Atlas plugin will only keep track of certificates issued through the plugin. However, outside certificates won't be visible nor can they be mutated.

## API

The Atlas secrets engine has a full HTTP API. Please see the
[Atlas secrets engine API](https://github.com/globalsign/atlas-hashicorp-vault/blob/master/website/pages/api-docs/secret/vault-plugin-secrets-atlas/index.mdx) for more
details.
