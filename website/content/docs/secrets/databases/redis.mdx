# Redis database secrets engine

Redis is one of the supported plugins for the database secrets engine. This
plugin generates database credentials dynamically based on configured roles for
the Redis database, and also supports [Static Roles](/vault/docs/secrets/databases#static-roles).

See the [database secrets engine](/vault/docs/secrets/databases) docs for
more information about setting up the database secrets engine.

## Capabilities

| Plugin Name                 | Root Credential Rotation | Dynamic Roles | Static Roles | Username Customization |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------ | ------------- | ------------ | ---------------------- |
| `redis-database-plugin`     | Yes                      | Yes           | Yes          | No                     |

## Setup

1.  Enable the database secrets engine if it is not already enabled:

    ```shell-session
    $ vault secrets enable database
    Success! Enabled the database secrets engine at: database/
    ```

    By default, the secrets engine will enable at the name of the engine. To
    enable the secrets engine at a different path, use the `-path` argument.

1.  Configure Vault with the proper plugin and connection configuration:

    ```shell-session
    $ vault write database/config/my-redis-database \
      plugin_name="redis-database-plugin" \
      host="localhost" \
      port=6379 \
      tls=true \
      ca_cert="$CACERT" \
      username="user" \
      password="pass" \
      allowed_roles="my-*-role"
    ```

1.  You should consider rotating the admin password. Note that if you do, the
    new password will never be made available through Vault, so you should
    create a Vault-specific database admin user for this.

    ```shell-session
    vault write -force database/rotate-root/my-redis-database
    ```

## Usage

After the secrets engine is configured, write dynamic and static roles
to Vault to enable generating credentials.

### Dynamic roles

1.  Configure a dynamic role that maps a name in Vault to a JSON string
    containing the Redis ACL rules, which are either documented [here](https://redis.io/commands/acl-cat) or in the output
    of the `ACL CAT` Redis command.

    ```shell-session
    $ vault write database/roles/my-dynamic-role \
        db_name="my-redis-database" \
        creation_statements='["+@admin"]' \
        default_ttl="5m" \
        max_ttl="1h"
    Success! Data written to: database/roles/my-dynamic-role
    ```

    Note that if a creation_statement is not provided the user account will
    default to a read only user, `'["~*", "+@read"]'` that can read any key.

1.  Generate a new set of credentials by reading from the `/creds` endpoint with the name
    of the role:

    ```shell-session
    $ vault read database/creds/my-dynamic-role
    Key                Value
    ---                -----
    lease_id           database/creds/my-dynamic-role/OxCTXJcxQ2F4lReWPjbezSnA
    lease_duration     5m
    lease_renewable    true
    password           dACqHsav6-attdv1glGZ
    username           V_TOKEN_MY-DYNAMIC-ROLE_YASUQUF3GVVD0ZWTEMK4_1608481717
    ```

### Static roles

1.  Configure a static role that maps a name in Vault to an existing Redis
    user.

    ```shell-session
    $ vault write database/static-roles/my-static-role \
        db_name="my-redis-database" \
        username="my-existing-redis-user" \
        rotation_period=5m
    Success! Data written to: database/static-roles/my-static-role
    ```

1.  Retrieve the credentials from the `/static-creds` endpoint:

    ```shell-session
    $ vault read database/static-creds/my-static-role
    Key                    Value
    ---                    -----
    last_vault_rotation    2020-12-20T10:39:49.647822-06:00
    password               ylKNgqa3NPVAioBf-0S5
    rotation_period        5m
    ttl                    4m39s
    username               my-existing-redis-user
    ```
