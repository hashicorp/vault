# Transform secrets engine

@include 'alerts/enterprise-and-hcp.mdx'

Transform secrets engine requires [Vault
Enterprise](https://www.hashicorp.com/products/vault/pricing) with the Advanced Data
Protection Transform (ADP-Transform) module.

The Transform secrets engine handles secure data transformation and tokenization
against provided input value. Transformation methods may encompass NIST vetted
cryptographic standards such as [format-preserving encryption
(FPE)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Format-preserving_encryption) via
[FF3-1](https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-38g/rev-1/draft), but
can also be pseudonymous transformations of the data through other means, such
as masking.

The secret engine currently supports `fpe`, `masking`, and `tokenization` as
data transformation types.

## Setup

Most secrets engines must be configured in advance before they can perform their
functions. These steps are usually completed by an operator or configuration
management tool.

1. Enable the Transform secrets engine:

   ```text
   $ vault secrets enable transform
   Success! Enabled the transform secrets engine at: transform/
   ```

   By default, the secrets engine will mount at the name of the engine. To enable
   the secrets engine at a different path, use the -path argument.

1. Create a named role:

   ```text
   $ vault write transform/role/payments transformations=ccn-fpe
   Success! Data written to: transform/role/payments
   ```

1. Create a transformation:

   ```text
   $ vault write transform/transformations/fpe/ccn-fpe \
     template=ccn \
     tweak_source=internal \
     allowed_roles=payments
   Success! Data written to: transform/transformations/fpe/ccn-fpe
   ```

1. Optionally, create a template:

   ```text
   $ vault write transform/template/ccn \
     type=regex \
     pattern='(\d{4})[- ](\d{4})[- ](\d{4})[- ](\d{4})' \
     encode_format='$1-$2-$3-$4' \
     decode_formats=last-four='$4' \
     alphabet=numerics
   Success! Data written to: transform/template/ccn
   ```

1. Optionally, create an alphabet:

   ```text
   $ vault write transform/alphabet/numerics \
       alphabet="0123456789"
   Success! Data written to: transform/alphabet/numerics
   ```

## Usage

After the secrets engine is configured and a user/machine has a Vault token with
the proper permission, it can use this secrets engine to encode and decode input
values.

1. Encode some input value using the `/encode` endpoint with a named role:

   ```text
   $ vault write transform/encode/payments value=1111-2222-3333-4444
   Key              Value
   ---              -----
   encoded_value    9300-3376-4943-8903
   ```

   A transformation must be provided if the role contains more than one
   transformation. A tweak must be provided if the tweak source for the
   transformation is "supplied".

1. Decode some input value using the `/decode` endpoint with a named role:

   ```text
   $ vault write transform/decode/payments value=9300-3376-4943-8903
   Key              Value
   ---              -----
   decoded_value    1111-2222-3333-4444
   ```

   A transformation must be provided if the role contains more than one
   transformation. A tweak must be provided if the tweak source for the
   transformation is "supplied" or "generated".

1. Decode some input value using the `/decode` endpoint with a named role and decode format:

   ```text
   $ vault write transform/decode/payments/last-four value=9300-3376-4943-8903
   Key              Value
   ---              -----
   decoded_value    4444
   ```

   A transformation must be provided if the role contains more than one
   transformation. A tweak must be provided if the tweak source for the
   transformation is "supplied" or "generated". A decode format can optionally
   be provided. If one isn't provided, the decoded output will be formatted to
   match the template's pattern as in the previous example.

## Roles, transformations, templates, and alphabets

The Transform secrets engine contains several types of resources that
encapsulate different aspects of the information required in order to perform
data transformation.

- **Roles** are the basic high-level construct that holds the set of
  transformation that it is allowed to performed. The role name is provided when
  performing encode and decode operations.

- **Transformations** hold information about a particular transformation. It
  contains information about the type of transformation that we want to perform,
  the template that it should use for value detection, and other
  transformation-specific values such as the tweak source or the masking character
  to use.

- **Templates** allow us to determine what and how to capture the value that we
  want to transform.

- **Alphabets** provide the set of valid UTF-8 character contained within both
  the input and transformed value on FPE transformations.

## Transformations

### Format preserving encryption

Format Preserving Encryption (FPE) performs cryptographically secure
transformation via FF3-1 to encode input values while maintaining its data
format and length.

#### Tweak and tweak source

FF3-1 uses a non-confidential parameter called the tweak along with the
ciphertext when performing encryption and decryption operations. The tweak
is precisely a 7-byte value. The secret engine consumes a base64 encoded string
of this value for its encode and decode operation whenever this input is
required.

In order to simplify the flow of encoding and decoding operations, transformation
creation can take care of generating and associating a tweak value. This allows
applications to provide a single value without having the need to generate or
store any other metadata.

In cases where more granularity is required, a tweak value can be generated by
Vault and returned, or it may be independently generated and provided.

In summary, there are three ways in which the tweak value may be sourced:

- `supplied`: This is the default behavior for FPE transformations. The tweak
  value must be generated externally, and supplied into the on encode and decode
  operations.
- `generated`: The secret engine will take care of generating the tweak value
  on encode operations and return this back as part of the response along
  with the encoded value. It is up to the application to store this value
  so that it can be provided back when decoding the encoded value.
- `internal`: The secret engine will generate an internal tweak value per
  transformation. This value is not returned on encode or decode operations
  since it gets re-used for all encode and decode operations for the
  transformation. Depending on the uniqueness of the dataset, this mode may
  introduce higher risks, but provides the most convenience since the value does
  not need to be stored separately. This mode should only be used if the values
  being encoded are sufficiently unique.

Your team and organization should weigh the trade-offs when it comes to
choosing the proper tweak source to use. For `supplied` and `internal`
sourcing, please see [FF3-1 Tweak Usage Details](/vault/docs/secrets/transform/ff3-tweak-details)

#### Input limits

FF3-1 specifies both minimum and maximum limits on the length of an input.
These limits are driven by the security goals, making sure that for a given
alphabet the input size does not leave the input guessable by brute force.

Given an alphabet of length A, an input length L is valid if:

- L >= 2,
- A<sup>L</sup> >= 1,000,000
- and L <= 2 \* floor(log<sub>A</sub>(2<sup>96</sup>)).

As a concrete example, for handling credit card numbers, A is 10, L is 16, so
valid input lengths would be between 6 and 56 characters. This is because
10<sup>6</sup>=1,000,000 (already greater than 2), and 2 \* floor(log<sub>10</sub>(2<sup>96</sup>)) = 56.

Of course, in the case of credit card numbers valid input would always be
between 12 and 19 decimal digits.

#### Output limitations

After transformation and formatting by the template, the value is an encrypted
version of the input with the format preserved. However, the value itself may
be _invalid_ with respect to other standards. For example the output credit card
number may not validate (it likely won't create a valid check digit).

So one must consider when the outputs are stored whether validation in storage
may reject them.

### Masking

Masking performs replacement of matched characters on the input value with a
desired character. This form of transformation is non-reversible and thus does
not support retrieving the original value back using the decode operation.

### Tokenization

[Tokenization](/vault/docs/secrets/transform/tokenization) exchanges a
sensitive value for an unrelated value called a _token_. The original sensitive
value cannot be recovered from a token alone, they are irreversible.

#### Inputs

Tokenization inputs are not processed by templates or alphabets, as they do not
preserve any of the contents or format of the input.

#### Outputs

Tokenization is not format preserving. The token output is a Base58 encoded
string value of unrelated length, and is not rendered by a template.

The decoded value is returned verbatim as it was before encoding.

#### Metadata

As tokenization isn't format preserving and is stateful, the input values can be
any length, subject to other limits in Vault's request processing. In addition,
non-sensitive _metadata_ can be encoded alongside the value, and retrieved either
with or independently of the original value.

#### Operations

In addition to encode and decode, as tokenization is stateful, it provides two
additional operations:

- Retrieve metadata given a token.
- Check whether an input value has a valid, unexpired token.
- For some configurations, retrieve a previously encoded token for a plaintext
  input.

#### Stores

Tokenization is stateful. Tokenized state can be stored internally (the
default) or in an external store. Currently only PostgreSQL, MySQL, and MSSQL are supported
for external storage.

#### Mapping modes

[Tokenization](/vault/docs/secrets/transform/tokenization) stores the results of an encode operation
in storage using a cryptographic construct that enhances the safety of its values.
In the `default` mapping mode, the token itself is transformed via a one way
function involving the transform key and elements of the token. As Vault does
not store the token, the values in Vault storage themselves cannot be used to
retrieve original input.

A second mapping mode, `exportable` is provided for cases where
operators may need to recover the full set of decoded inputs in an emergency via
the export operation. It is strongly recommended that one use the `default` mode if
possible, as it is resistant to more types of attack.

#### Convergent tokenization

~> **Note:** Convergent tokenization is not supported for transformations with
imported keys.

In addition, tokenization transformations may be configured as *convergent*, meaning
that tokenizing a plaintext and expiration more than once results in the
same token value.  Enabling convergence has performance and security
[considerations](/vault/docs/secrets/transform/tokenization#convergence).

## Deletion behavior

The deletion of resources, aside from roles, is guarded by checking whether any
other related resources are currently using it in order to avoid accidental data
loss of any encoded value that may depend on these bits of information to
decode and reconstruct the original value. Role deletion can be safely done
since the information related to the transformation itself is contained within
transformation object and its related resources.

The following rules applies when it comes to deleting a resource:

- A transformation cannot be deleted if it's in use by a role.
- A template or store cannot be deleted if it's in use by a transformation.
- An alphabet cannot be deleted if it's in use by a template.

## Provided builtin resources

The secret engine provides a set of builtin templates and alphabets that are
considered common. Builtin templates cannot be deleted, and the prefix
"builtin/" on template and alphabet names is a reserved keyword.

### Templates

The following builtin templates are available for use in the secret engine:

- builtin/creditcardnumber
- builtin/socialsecuritynumber

Note that these templates only check for the matching pattern(s), and not the
validity of the value itself. For instance, the builtin credit card number
template can determine whether the provided value is in the format of commonly
issued credit cards, but not whether the credit card is a valid number from a
particular issuer.

Templates currently only accept regular expressions as the matching pattern
type. It uses Go's standard library for the regexp engine, which supports
[the RE2 syntax](https://github.com/google/re2/wiki/Syntax).

**Note**: The `builtin/any` template is only valid and is the default for the tokenization
transform.

### Alphabets

The following builtin alphabets are available for use in the secret engine:

- builtin/numeric
- builtin/alphalower
- builtin/alphaupper
- builtin/alphanumericlower
- builtin/alphanumericupper
- builtin/alphanumeric

Custom alphabets must contain between 2 and 65536 unique characters.

### Stores

The following builtin store is available (and is the default) for tokenization
transformations:

- builtin/internal

Refer to the [Transform Secrets Engine](/vault/tutorials/adp/transform) tutorial to learn how to use the Transform secrets engine to handle secure data transmission and tokenization against provided secrets.

## Bring your own key (BYOK)

~> **Note:** Key import functionality supports cases where there is a need to bring
in an existing key from an HSM or other outside systems. It is more secure to
have Transform generate and manage a key within Vault.

### Via the Command Line

The Vault command line tool [includes a helper](/vault/docs/commands/transform/) to perform the steps described
in Manual below. 

### Via the API

First, the wrapping key needs to be read from the transform secrets engine:

```text
$ vault read transform/wrapping_key
```

The wrapping key will be a 4096-bit RSA public key.

Then, the wrapping key is used to create the ciphertext input for the `import` endpoint,
as described below. The target key refers to the key being imported.

### HSM

If the key is being imported from an HSM that supports PKCS#11, there are
two possible scenarios:

- If the HSM supports the CKM_RSA_AES_KEY_WRAP mechanism, it can be used to wrap the
target key using the wrapping key.

- Otherwise, two mechanisms can be combined to wrap the target key. First, a 256-bit AES key is
generated and then used to wrap the target key using the CKM_AES_KEY_WRAP_KWP mechanism.
Then the AES key should be wrapped under the wrapping key using the CKM_RSA_PKCS_OAEP mechanism
using MGF1 and either SHA-1, SHA-224, SHA-256, SHA-384, or SHA-512.

The ciphertext is constructed by appending the wrapped target key to the wrapped AES key.

The ciphertext bytes should be base64-encoded.

### Manual process

If the target key is not stored in an HSM or KMS, the following steps can be used to construct
the ciphertext for the input of the `import` endpoint:

1. Generate an ephemeral 256-bit AES key.

2. Wrap the target key using the ephemeral AES key with AES-KWP.

3. Wrap the AES key under the Vault wrapping key using RSAES-OAEP with MGF1 and
either SHA-1, SHA-224, SHA-256, SHA-384, or SHA-512.

4. Delete the ephemeral AES key.

5. Append the wrapped target key to the wrapped AES key.

6. Base64 encode the result.

For more details on the key wrapping process, see the [key wrapping guide](/vault/docs/secrets/transit/key-wrapping-guide)
(be sure to use the transform wrapping key when wrapping a key for import into the transform secrets engine).
