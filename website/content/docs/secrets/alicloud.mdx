# AliCloud secrets engine

The AliCloud secrets engine dynamically generates AliCloud access tokens based on RAM
policies, or AliCloud STS credentials based on RAM roles. This generally
makes working with AliCloud easier, since it does not involve clicking in the web UI.
The AliCloud access tokens are time-based and are automatically revoked when the Vault
lease expires. STS credentials are short-lived, non-renewable, and expire on their own.

## Setup

Most secrets engines must be configured in advance before they can perform their
functions. These steps are usually completed by an operator or configuration
management tool.

1.  Enable the AliCloud secrets engine:

    ```text
    $ vault secrets enable alicloud
    Success! Enabled the alicloud secrets engine at: alicloud/
    ```

    By default, the secrets engine will mount at the name of the engine. To
    enable the secrets engine at a different path, use the `-path` argument.

1.  [Create a custom policy](https://www.alibabacloud.com/help/doc-detail/28640.htm)
    in AliCloud that will be used for the access key you will give Vault. See "Example
    RAM Policy for Vault".

1.  [Create a user](https://www.alibabacloud.com/help/faq-detail/28637.htm) in AliCloud
    with a name like "hashicorp-vault", and directly apply the new custom policy to that user
    in the "User Authorization Policies" section.

1.  Create an access key for that user in AliCloud, which is an action available in
    AliCloud's UI on the user's page.

1.  Configure that access key as the credentials that Vault will use to communicate with
    AliCloud to generate credentials:

    ```text
    $ vault write alicloud/config \
        access_key=0wNEpMMlzy7szvai \
        secret_key=PupkTg8jdmau1cXxYacgE736PJj4cA
    ```

    Alternatively, the AliCloud secrets engine can pick up credentials set as environment variables,
    or credentials available through instance metadata. Since it checks current credentials on every API call,
    changes in credentials will be picked up almost immediately without a Vault restart.

    If available, we recommend using instance metadata for these credentials as they are the most
    secure option. To do so, simply ensure that the instance upon which Vault is running has sufficient
    privileges, and do not add any config.

1.  Configure a role describing how credentials will be granted.

    To generate access tokens using only policies that have already been created in AliCloud:

    ```text
    $ vault write alicloud/role/policy-based \
        remote_policies='name:AliyunOSSReadOnlyAccess,type:System' \
        remote_policies='name:AliyunRDSReadOnlyAccess,type:System'
    ```

    To generate access tokens using only policies that will be dynamically created in AliCloud by
    Vault:

    ```text
    $ vault write alicloud/role/policy-based \
        inline_policies=-<<EOF
    [
        {
          "Statement": [
            {
              "Action": "rds:Describe*",
              "Effect": "Allow",
              "Resource": "*"
            }
          ],
          "Version": "1"
        },
        {...}
    ]
    EOF
    ```

    Both `inline_policies` and `remote_policies` may be used together. However, neither may be
    used configuring how to generate STS credentials, like so:

    ```text
    $ vault write alibaba/role/role-based \
          role_arn='acs:ram::5138828231865461:role/hastrustedactors'
    ```

    Any `role_arn` specified must have added "trusted actors" when it was being created. These
    can only be added at role creation time. Trusted actors are entities that can assume the role.
    Since we will be assuming the role to gain credentials, the `access_key` and `secret_key` in
    the config must qualify as a trusted actor.

### Example RAM policy for Vault

While AliCloud credentials can be supplied by environment variables, an explicit
setting in the `alicloud/config`, or through instance metadata, the resulting
credentials need sufficient permissions to issue secrets. The necessary permissions
vary based on the ways roles are configured.

This is an example RAM policy that would allow you to create credentials using
any type of role:

```json
{
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Action": [
        "ram:CreateAccessKey",
        "ram:DeleteAccessKey",
        "ram:CreatePolicy",
        "ram:DeletePolicy",
        "ram:AttachPolicyToUser",
        "ram:DetachPolicyFromUser",
        "ram:CreateUser",
        "ram:DeleteUser",
        "sts:AssumeRole"
      ],
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Resource": "*"
    }
  ],
  "Version": "1"
}
```

However, the policy you use should only allow the actions you actually need
for how your roles are configured.

If any roles are using `inline_policies`, you need the following actions:

- `"ram:CreateAccessKey"`
- `"ram:DeleteAccessKey"`
- `"ram:AttachPolicyToUser"`
- `"ram:DetachPolicyFromUser"`
- `"ram:CreateUser"`
- `"ram:DeleteUser"`

If any roles are using `remote_policies`, you need the following actions:

- All listed for `inline_policies`
- `"ram:CreatePolicy"`
- `"ram:DeletePolicy"`

If any roles are using `role_arn`, you need the following actions:

- `"sts:AssumeRole"`

## Usage

After the secrets engine is configured and a user/machine has a Vault token with
the proper permission, it can generate credentials.

1.  Generate a new access key by reading from the `/creds` endpoint with the name
    of the role:

    ```text
    $ vault read alicloud/creds/policy-based
    Key                Value
    ---                -----
    lease_id           alicloud/creds/policy-based/f3e92392-7d9c-09c8-c921-575d62fe80d8
    lease_duration     768h
    lease_renewable    true
    access_key         0wNEpMMlzy7szvai
    secret_key         PupkTg8jdmau1cXxYacgE736PJj4cA
    ```

    The `access_key` and `secret_key` returned are also known is an
    `"AccessKeyId"`and `"AccessKeySecret"`, respectively, in the Alibaba's
    docs.

    Retrieving creds for a role using a `role_arn` will carry the additional
    fields of `expiration` and `security_token`, like so:

    ```text
    $ vault read alicloud/creds/role-based
    Key                Value
    ---                -----
    lease_id           alicloud/creds/role-based/f3e92392-7d9c-09c8-c921-575d62fe80d9
    lease_duration     59m59s
    lease_renewable    false
    access_key         STS.L4aBSCSJVMuKg5U1vFDw
    secret_key         wyLTSmsyPGP1ohvvw8xYgB29dlGI8KMiH2pKCNZ9
