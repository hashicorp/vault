# MongoDB atlas secrets engine

The MongoDB Atlas secrets engine generates Programmatic API keys. The created MongoDB Atlas secrets are
time-based and are automatically revoked when the Vault lease expires, unless renewed.

Vault will create a Programmatic API key for each lease that provide appropriate access to the defined MongoDB Atlas
project or organization with appropriate role(s). The MongoDB Atlas Programmatic API Key Public and
Private Keys are returned to the caller. To learn more about Programmatic API Keys visit the
[Programmatic API Keys Doc](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/configure-api-access/#programmatic-api-keys).

  <Note>

  The information below relates to the **MongoDB Altas secrets engine**. Refer to the
  [MongoDB Atlas **database** secrets engine](/vault/docs/secrets/databases/mongodbatlas)
  for information about using the MongoDB Atlas database plugin for the Vault
  database secrets engine.

  </Note>

## Setup

Most secrets engines must be configured in advance before they can perform their functions. These
steps are usually completed by an operator or configuration management tool.

1. Enable the MongoDB Atlas secrets engine:

   ```shell-session
   $ vault secrets enable mongodbatlas
   Success! Enabled the mongodbatlas secrets engine at: mongodbatlas/
   ```

   By default, the secrets engine will mount at the name of the engine. To
   enable the secrets engine at a different path, use the `-path` argument.

1. It's necessary to generate and configure a MongoDB Atlas Programmatic API Key for your organization
   or project that has sufficient permissions to allow Vault to create other Programmatic API Keys.

   In order to grant Vault programmatic access to an organization or project using only the
   [API](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/reference/api-resources-spec/v2/) you need to create a MongoDB Atlas Programmatic API
   Key with the appropriate roles if you have not already done so. A Programmatic API Key consists
   of a public and private key, so ensure you have both. Regarding roles, the Organization Owner and
   Project Owner roles should be sufficient for most needs, however be sure to check what each role
   grants in the [MongoDB Atlas Programmatic API Key User Roles documentation](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/reference/user-roles/).
   It is recommended to set an IP Network Access list when creating the key.

   For more detailed instructions on how to create a Programmatic API Key in the Atlas UI, including
   available roles, visit the [Programmatic API Key documentation](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/configure-api-access/#programmatic-api-keys).

1. Once you have a MongoDB Atlas Programmatic Key pair, as created in the previous step, Vault can now
   be configured to use it with MongoDB Atlas:

   ```shell-session
   $ vault write mongodbatlas/config \
       public_key=yhltsvan \
       private_key=2c130c23-e6b6-4da8-a93f-a8bf33218830
   ```

   Internally, Vault will connect to MongoDB Atlas using these credentials. As such,
   these credentials must be a superset of any policies which might be granted
   on API Keys.

  <Note>

  It is highly recommended to _not_ use your MongoDB Atlas root account credentials.
  Generate a dedicated Programmatic API key with appropriate roles instead.

  </Note>

## Programmatic API keys

Programmatic API Key credential types use a Vault role to generate a Programmatic API Key at
either the MongoDB Atlas Organization or Project level with the designated role(s) for programmatic access.

Programmatic API Keys:

- Have two parts, a public key and a private key
- Cannot be used to log into Atlas through the user interface
- Must be granted appropriate roles to complete required tasks
- Must belong to one organization, but may be granted access to any number of
  projects in that organization.
- May have an IP Network Access list configured and some capabilities may require a
  Network Access list to be configured (these are noted in the MongoDB Atlas API
  documentation).

Create a Vault role for a MongoDB Atlas Programmatic API Key by mapping appropriate arguments to the
organization or project designated:

- Organization API Key: Set `organization_id` argument with the appropriate
  [Organization Level Roles](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/reference/user-roles/#organization-roles).
- Project API Key: Set `project_id` with the appropriate [Project Level Roles](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/reference/user-roles/#project-roles).

  <Note>

  Programmatic API keys can belong to only one Organization but can belong to one or more Projects.

  </Note>

Examples:

```shell-session
$ vault write mongodbatlas/roles/test \
    organization_id=5b23ff2f96e82130d0aaec13 \
    roles=ORG_MEMBER
```

```shell-session
$ vault write mongodbatlas/roles/test \
    project_id=5cf5a45a9ccf6400e60981b6 \
    roles=GROUP_DATA_ACCESS_READ_ONLY
```

## Programmatic API key network access list

~> **Note:** MongoDB Atlas has deprecated whitelists, and the API will be disabled in June 2021. It is replaced by a
similar access list API which is live now. If you specify CIDR blocks or IP addresses to allow, you need to run **Vault
1.6.3 or greater** to avoid interruption. See [MongoDB Atlas documentation](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/reference/api-resources-spec/v2/#tag/Project-IP-Access-List)
for further details.

Programmatic API Key access can and should be limited with a IP Network Access list. In the following example both a CIDR
block and IP address are added to the IP Network Access list for Keys generated with this Vault role:

```shell-session
  $ vault write atlas/roles/test \
      project_id=5cf5a45a9ccf6400e60981b6 \
      roles=GROUP_CLUSTER_MANAGER \
      cidr_blocks=192.168.1.3/32 \
      ip_addresses=192.168.1.3
```

Verify the created Programmatic API Key Vault role has the added CIDR block and IP address by running:

```shell-session
  $ vault read atlas/roles/test

    Key                       Value
    ---                       -----
    cidr_blocks               [192.168.1.3/32]
    ip_addresses              [192.168.1.3]
    max_ttl                   1h
    organization_id           n/a
    roles                     [GROUP_CLUSTER_MANAGER]
    project_id                5cf5a45a9ccf6400e60981b6
    roles                     n/a
    ttl                       30m
```

## TTL and max TTL

Programmatic API Keys Vault have a time-to-live (TTL) and maximum time-to-live (Max TTL).
When a credential expires it's automatically revoked. You can set the TTL and Max TTL for each role
or by tuning the secrets engine's configuration.

The following creates a Vault role "test" for a Project level Programmatic API key with a 2 hour time-to-live and a
max time-to-live of 5 hours.

```shell-session
$ vault write mongodbatlas/roles/test \
    project_id=5cf5a45a9ccf6400e60981b6 \
    roles=GROUP_DATA_ACCESS_READ_ONLY \
    ttl=2h \
    max_ttl=5h
```

You can verify the role that you have created with:

```shell-session
$ vault read mongodbatlas/roles/test

    Key                       Value
    ---                       -----
    organization_id           5b71ff2f96e82120d0aaec14
    roles                     [GROUP_DATA_ACCESS_READ_ONLY]
    project_id                5cf5a45a9ccf6400e60981b6
    roles                     n/a
    ttl                       2h0m0s
    max_ttl                   5h0m0s
```

## Generating credentials

After a user has authenticated to Vault has has sufficient permissions, a read request to the
`creds` endpoint for the role will generate and return new Programmatic API Keys:

```shell-session
$ vault read mongodbatlas/creds/test

    Key                Value
    ---                -----
    lease_id           mongodbatlas/creds/test/0fLBv1c2YDzPlJB1PwsRRKHR
    lease_duration     2h
    lease_renewable    true
    description        vault-test-1563980947-1318
    private_key        905ae89e-6ee8-40rd-ab12-613t8e3fe836
    public_key         klpruxce
```
