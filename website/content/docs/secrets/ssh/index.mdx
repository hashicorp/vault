# SSH Secrets Engine

Name: `ssh`

The Vault SSH secrets engine provides secure authentication and authorization
for access to machines via the SSH protocol. The Vault SSH secrets engine helps
manage access to machine infrastructure, providing several ways to issue SSH
credentials.

The Vault SSH secrets engine supports the following modes. Each mode is
individually documented on its own page.

- [Signed SSH Certificates](/vault/docs/secrets/ssh/signed-ssh-certificates)
- [One-time SSH Passwords](/vault/docs/secrets/ssh/one-time-ssh-passwords)
- [Dynamic SSH Keys](/vault/docs/secrets/ssh/dynamic-ssh-keys) <sup>DEPRECATED</sup>

All guides assume a basic familiarity with the SSH protocol.
