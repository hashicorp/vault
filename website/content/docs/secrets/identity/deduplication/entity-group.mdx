# Fix entity and group duplicates

Fix duplicate identities for entities and groups targeted for renaming.

<Tip title="Assumptions">

- You are running Vault 1.19 or later.
- You have [deduplication **renaming** targets in your system logs](/vault/docs/upgrading/identity-deduplication).
- You have admin permission on the relevant Vault server or cluster.

</Tip>


## Why duplicates happen

Historical bugs in Vault allowed authN mounts to create duplicate entries of the
same entity or group name if the names used difference cases. By default, Vault
uses case-insensitive matching for names and considers `bob` and `BOB` to be the
same name. But, past bugs have allowed for identical or different-case
duplicates in entity and group names.

Duplicate entity and group names can cause unexpected behavior and make working
with Vault more difficult:

- Fetching entities/groups by name returns the first identity found. Depending
  on your Vault version, the identity returned can vary depending on the server
  handling the request and when the last seal/unseal event occurred.
- Deleting entities/groups by name is not guaranteed to delete all duplicates.
- All lookup requests **must** use ID to find the right identity.
  individual identity.

## Example server log

The Vault system log provides warnings about duplicate entities and groups,
including:

- the entity/group name
- the associated namespace (`namespace ID`)
- the entity/group ID (`id`)
- the expected deduplication action (`force_deduplication`)

Duplicate entities and groups might be exact matches or differ in case (for
example, `Admin` and `admin`). But when reviewing system logs for duplicate
resolution, always consider the associated namespace when grouping potential
duplicates. For example, despite having identical, case-insensitive names in the
example logs, Vault only targets 8 for renaming because the names belong to
different namespaces:

Identity type | Old name            | New name
------------- | ------------------- | --------
Entity        | `root/entity-cAsE`  | Unchanged
Entity        | `root/entity-case`  | `root/entity-case-290a643d-6043-da5e-943f-3a3d09e4ecbd`
Entity        | `root/entity-case`  | `root/entity-case-b0141be5-3f03-a1c7-a57b-02f045d04426`
Entity        | `sYMXY/entity-cAsE` | Unchanged
Entity        | `sYMXY/entity-case` | `sYMXY/entity-case-9d3be96f-490a-9625-3118-896bd2b3a5f3`
Entity        | `sYMXY/entity-case` | `sYMXY/entity-case-d82231d2-3716-6b9c-e80d-7d09c0409739`
Group         | `root/group-case`   | Unchanged
Group         | `root/group-cAsE`   | `group-cAsE-9fe86ea0-f80c-1131-5be1-1d6e3b70237f`
Group         | `root/group-case`   | `group-case-32dd070c-c1f8-c796-9a71-15887014b813`
Group         | `sYMXY/group-case`  | Unchanged
Group         | `sYMXY/group-case`  | `group-case-f11277b3-d985-4d72-d2e9-9c8c6c0db02c`
Group         | `sYMXY/group-cAsE`  | `group-cAsE-07c753d07-b0d9-e13b-6184-48247b8f7504`


The automatic renaming process is security safe and preserves existing data.
Renaming **does not** grant new permissions to existing tokens and **does not**
delete data, so you can manually roll back the change if necessary.


## Resolving entity and group duplicates

In most cases, renaming preserves resource access such that logins and
permissions remain unaffected. But, there are two edge cases you may need to
address before deduplication: **templated policies** and **external references**.

- If you use templated ACL policies that reference an entity or group name as
  part of the resource path, deduplication may affect access to those resources.

- If you use Terraform to manage Vault resources or have other systems outside
  Vault that reference entity or group names, those references will break when the
  deduplication process renames those entities/groups.


For each duplicate identified by the logs, you have 3 options:

1. **If you know you do not need or use the renaming target**, you can use
   the
   [`/identity/entity/id/{id}`](/vault/api-docs/secret/identity/entity#delete-entity-by-id) and
   [`/identity/group/id/{id}`](/vault/api-docs/secret/identity/group#delete-group-by-id)
   endpoints to delete the identities by ID.

1. **If you know the risk to templated policies or external references is low or
   nonexistent**, you can opt to ignore the duplicates and address issues
   if/when they occur.


1. **If you cannot confirm the risk to templated policies or external references**,
   review the guidance in the following troubleshooting guide:
    - [Resolve deduplication impact on ACL policy templates](/vault/docs/secrets/identity/deduplication/acl-policy-templates)
    - [Resolve deduplication impact on Terraform resource references](/vault/docs/secrets/identity/deduplication/external-refs)

## Next steps 

Once you are comfortable that all the entity and group duplicates are properly
addressed, you can
[enable forced identity deduplication](/vault/docs/secrets/identity/deduplication#dedupe-flag).
