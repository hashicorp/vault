# Find and resolve duplicate Vault identities

Bugs in Vault versions before 1.19 might lead to duplicate
[identities](/vault/docs/concepts/identity) for entities, aliases, and groups.
Duplicate identities in the persistent storage of a Vault cluster can cause
unexpected behavior as duplicate identities are outside typical expectations and
test scenarios for Vault.

Vault server logs include information to help you identify when duplicate
identities exist in a given cluster. We strongly recommend identifying
and resolving duplicates as soon as possible to return your Vault clusters to
normal, supported behavior.

## Before you start

- **You must have Vault 1.19 or later running on all clusters**. Vault only logs
  deduplication details once you upgrade to 1.19+. 
- **You must have admin permissions for the Vault cluster**.

## Step 1: Look for duplicates

To identify duplicates in server logs:

1. Look for `core: post-unseal setup starting` to find the last unseal operation
   in the system logs of the active node. For example:

    ```text
    [INFO]  core: post-unseal setup starting
    ...<check here> ...
    [INFO]  core: post-unseal setup complete
    ```

1. Check for `DUPLICATES DETECTED` between the `setup starting` and
   `setup complete` entries in the system log. For example:

    ```text
    [WARN]  identity: DUPLICATES DETECTED, see following logs for details [...]
    ```

If you do not see entries for `DUPLICATES DETECTED`, the current cluster is
clean and you can move to the next cluster. If you confirm none of the logs
have duplicates, you can jump to [Step #4](#dedupe-flag).

<Note>

If you use replication, repeat the duplication check on all primary clusters and
all **performance replication** (PR) secondary clusters. PR secondary clusters
handle client requests and may have additional, **local** duplicates.

Disaster recovery (DR) secondaries do not handle client requests, so you do not
need to check DR secondary clusters separately.

</Note>

## Step 2: Find deduplication targets

If you find `DUPLICATES DETECTED` in the system logs, create a list of same-case
aliases and renaming targets from the system log to make working through
duplicate resolution easier. If you have a large number of deduplication targets,
you can use the following script to pull out the relevant items and create
four files:

- **`unseal-process.log`** - section of the system log specific to the unseal
  process.
- **`merge-details.txt`** - same-case identities Vault will auto-merge during
  deduplication.
- **`rename-targets.txt`** - entities and group names in the form
  `namespace/name` Vault will rename during deduplication.
- **`rename-details.txt`** - full rename details for rename targets.

```bash

declare -A identity_key=(
  ['entity_alias']="identity: entity-alias"
  ['entity_rename']="identity: entity"
  ['group_rename']="identity: group"
)

declare -A match_str=(
  ['has_rename']="would rename to"
  ['has_merge']="would merge"
  ['rename']="s/.*would rename to \(.*\)\".*/\1/"
  ['group_name']="s/.*identity: group \"\(.*\)\" with.*/\1/"
  ['entity_name']="s/.*identity: entity \"\(.*\)\" with.*/\1/"
  ['namespace']="s/.*namespace ID \"\(.*\)\" duplicates.*/\1/"
)

declare -A rename_targets

# Grab the unseal portion of the log
log_start="core: post-unseal setup starting"
log_stop="core: post-unseal setup complete"
sed "/${log_start}/,/${log_stop}/!d;/${log_stop}/q" ../short.log > unseal-process.log

while read line;
do

  # The log line relates to a renamed identity
  if [[ "${line}" == *"${match_str['has_rename']}"* ]] ; then

    if [[ "${line}" == *"${identity_key['entity_rename']}"* ]] ; then
      type="${identity_key['entity_rename']}"
      name_match="${match_str['entity_name']}"
    fi
    if [[ "${line}" == *"${identity_key['group_rename']}"* ]] ; then
      type="${identity_key['group_rename']}"
      name_match="${match_str['group_name']}"
    fi

    new=$(echo $line | sed -e "${match_str['rename']}")
    old=$(echo $line | sed -e "${name_match}")
    space=$(echo $line | sed -e "${match_str['namespace']}")
    rename_targets["${space}/${old}"]="[${type}] ${space}/${old} --> ${space}/${new}"

  fi

  # The line indicates a same-case merge operation
  if [[ "${line}" == *"${match_str['has_merge']}"* ]] ; then
    merge_details=$(echo $line | sed -e "${identity_key['entity_alias']}")
    echo ${merge_details} >> merge-details.txt
  fi

done < unseal-process.log

# Save the rename target information to files for further processing
root_ns="root/"
for name in "${!rename_targets[@]}"
do
  echo ${name//"${root_ns}"/""} >> rename-targets.txt
  echo ${rename_targets["${name}"]} >> rename-details.txt
done
```


## Step 3: Resolve any duplicates

If you **did not** find duplicates in the log, you can jump to
[Step #5](#dedupe-flag).

If you **did** find duplicates in the logs:

1. Identify the duplication type for each entry in your server logs:
    - **In PR/DR deployments**: identify duplication types on your primary
      clusters.
    - **In PR deployments**: identify duplication types for **local aliases** on
      your performance secondaries. Local duplicates exist independently on the
      secondary cluster and require explicit resolution but follow the same
      process as resolving non-local different-case entity alias duplicates.

1. Follow the appropriate de-duplication steps based on the duplication type:
    - [Fix different-case entity alias duplicates](/vault/docs/secrets/identity/deduplication/different-case)
    - [Fix entity and group duplicates](/vault/docs/secrets/identity/deduplication/entity-group)


## Step 4: Prepare for (possible) latency impacts

When you activate deduplication for a cluster, the cluster reloads the in-memory
cache of all entities, aliases and groups. When deduplication replicates to
performance replication secondaries and performance standby nodes, those nodes
also pause and reload their identity system caches.

Vault remains unsealed during deduplication, but nodes may pause processing
other requests until deduplication completes. On **moderately large** clusters,
deduplication may take long enough to impact request latencies. On **large**
clusters, deduplication may take longer than 30 seconds, which could cause some
requests to timeout.

In general, deduplication should take less time than sealing and unsealing Vault
and be less disruptive than a regular failover. And clusters that had duplicates
should see their future `unseal` times reduced.


## Step 5: Enforce identity de-duplication ((#dedupe-flag))

Once you resolve existing duplicates, you can enable the
`force-identity-deduplication` activation flag on the primary cluster using the
[activation flag API path](/vault/api-docs/system/activation-flags).

Activating feature flags is a one-time, one-way action. Once you activate a
feature gated with a feature flag, you cannot un-activate the feature.

```shell-session
vault write -f sys/activation-flags/force-identity-deduplication/activate
``` 

</Tab>

<Tab heading="API" group="api">

```shell-session
$ curl                                      \
  --request PUT                             \
  --header "X-Vault-Token: ${VAULT_TOKEN}"  \
  ${VAULT_ADDR}/v1/sys/activation-flags/force-identity-deduplication/activate
```

</Tab>

</Tabs>

You can track the start and end of deduplication on each node in the system
by looking for `force-identity-deduplication activated` entries in the logs:
	
```
INFO core: force-identity-deduplication activated, reloading identity store
...
INFO core: force-identity-deduplication activated, reloading identity store complete
```

Going forward, Vault requires unique identities and re-runs the deduplication
check as a part of the unseal process. You can review the impact on unseal time
by reviewing system log timestamps. The difference between the log lines
`core: post-unseal setup starting` and `core: post-unseal setup complete`
indicates the total unseal time required for the cluster.
