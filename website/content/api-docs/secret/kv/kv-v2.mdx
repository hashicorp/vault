# KV secrets engine - version 2 (API)

This is the API documentation for the Vault KV secrets engine while running in
versioned mode. For general information about the usage and operation of the version 2
KV secrets engine, please see the [Vault KV documentation](/vault/docs/secrets/kv/kv-v2).
For information about the differences between KV version 1 and version 2, please [see the KV overview
documentation](/vault/docs/secrets/kv).

## Configure the KV engine

This path configures backend level settings that are applied to every key in the
key-value store.

| Method | Path                         |
|:-------|:-----------------------------|
| `POST` | `/:secret-mount-path/config` |

### Parameters

- `secret-mount-path` `(string: <required>)` - The path to the KV mount to config,
  such as `secret`. This is specified as part of the URL.

- `max_versions` `(int: 0)` – The number of versions to keep per key. This value
  applies to all keys, but a key's metadata setting can overwrite this value.
  Once a key has more than the configured allowed versions, the oldest version
  will be permanently deleted. When 0 is used or the value is unset, Vault
  will keep 10 versions.

- `cas_required` `(bool: false)` – If true all keys will require the cas
  parameter to be set on all write requests.

- `delete_version_after` `(string:"0s")` – If set, specifies the length
  of time before a version is deleted.
  Accepts [duration format strings](/vault/docs/concepts/duration-format).

### Sample payload

```json
{
  "max_versions": 5,
  "cas_required": false,
  "delete_version_after": "3h25m19s"
}
```

### Sample request

```shell-session
$ curl \
    --header "X-Vault-Token: ..." \
    --request POST \
    --data @payload.json \
    https://127.0.0.1:8200/v1/secret/config
```

## Read KV engine configuration

This path retrieves the current configuration for the secrets backend at the
given path.

| Method | Path                         |
|:-------|:-----------------------------|
| `GET`  | `/:secret-mount-path/config` |

### Parameters

- `secret-mount-path` `(string: <required>)` - The path to the KV mount to read the config,
  of, such as `secret`. This is specified as part of the URL.

  "data": {
    "cas_required": false,
    "delete_version_after": "3h25m19s",
    "max_versions": 0
  }
}
```

## Read secret version

This endpoint retrieves the secret at the specified location. The metadata
fields `created_time`, `deletion_time`, `destroyed`, and `version` are version
specific. The `custom_metadata` field is part of the secret's key metadata and
is included in the response whether or not the calling token has `read` access to
the associated [metadata endpoint](/vault/api-docs/secret/kv/kv-v2#read-secret-metadata).

| Method | Path                                                     |
|:-------|:---------------------------------------------------------|
| `GET`  | `/:secret-mount-path/data/:path?version=:version-number` |

### Parameters

- `secret-mount-path` `(string: <required>)` - The path to the KV mount containing
  the secret to read, such as `secret`. This is specified as part of the URL.
- `path` `(string: <required>)` – Specifies the path of the secret to read.
  This is specified as part of the URL.
- `version` `(int: 0)` - Specifies the version to return. If not set the latest
  version is returned.

### Sample request

```shell-session
$ curl \
    --header "X-Vault-Token: ..." \
    https://127.0.0.1:8200/v1/secret/data/my-secret?version=2
```

### Sample response

```json
{
  "data": {
    "data": {
      "foo": "bar"
    },
    "metadata": {
      "created_time": "2018-03-22T02:24:06.945319214Z",
      "custom_metadata": {
        "owner": "jdoe",
        "mission_critical": "false"
      },
      "deletion_time": "",
      "destroyed": false,
      "version": 2
    }
  }
}
```

## Create/Update secret

This endpoint creates a new version of a secret at the specified location. If
the value does not yet exist, the calling token must have an ACL policy granting
the `create` capability. If the value already exists, the calling token must
have an ACL policy granting the `update` capability.

| Method | Path                             |
|:-------|:---------------------------------|
| `POST` | `/:secret-mount-path/data/:path` |

### Parameters

- `secret-mount-path` `(string: <required>)` - The path to the KV mount containing
  the secret to update, such as `secret`. This is specified as part of the URL.

- `path` `(string: <required>)` – Specifies the path of the secret to update.
  This is specified as part of the URL.

- `options` `(Map: <optional>)` – An object that holds option settings.

  - `cas` `(int: <optional>)` - This flag is required if `cas_required` is set
    to true on either the secret or the engine's config. If not set the write
    will be allowed. In order for a write to be successful, `cas` must be set to
    the current version of the secret. If set to 0 a write will only be allowed if
    the key doesn't exist as unset keys do not have any version information. Also
    remember that soft deletes do not remove any underlying version data from storage.
    In order to write to a soft deleted key, the cas parameter must match the key's
    current version.

- `data` `(Map: <required>)` – The contents of the data map will be stored and
  returned on read.

### Sample payload

```json
{
  "options": {
    "cas": 0
  },
  "data": {
    "foo": "bar",
    "zip": "zap"
  }
}
```

### Sample request

```shell-session
$ curl \
    --header "X-Vault-Token: ..." \
    --request POST \
    --data @payload.json \
    https://127.0.0.1:8200/v1/secret/data/my-secret
```

### Sample response

```json
{
  "data": {
    "created_time": "2018-03-22T02:36:43.986212308Z",
    "custom_metadata": {
      "owner": "jdoe",
      "mission_critical": "false"
    },
    "deletion_time": "",
    "destroyed": false,
    "version": 1
  }
}
```

## Patch secret

This endpoint provides the ability to patch an _existing_ secret at the specified
location. The secret must neither be deleted nor destroyed. The calling token must
have an ACL policy granting the `patch` capability. Currently, only
[JSON merge patch](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-appsawg-json-merge-patch-07)
is supported and must be specified using a `Content-Type` header value of
`application/merge-patch+json`. A new version will be created upon successfully
applying a patch with the provided data.

| Method  | Path                             |
|:--------|:---------------------------------|
| `PATCH` | `/:secret-mount-path/data/:path` |

### Parameters

- `secret-mount-path` `(string: <required>)` - The path to the KV mount containing
   the secret to patch, such as `secret`. This is specified as part of the URL.

- `path` `(string: <required>)` – Specifies the path of the secret to patch.
   This is specified as part of the URL.

- `options` `(Map: <optional>)` – An object that holds option settings.

  - `cas` `(int: <optional>)` - This flag is required if `cas_required` is set to true on either
    the secret or the engine's config. In order for a write to be successful, `cas` must be set
    to the current version of the secret. A patch operation must be attempted on an existing
    key, thus the provided `cas` value must be greater than 0.

- `data` `(Map: <required>)` – The contents of the data map will be applied as a partial
  update to the existing entry via a JSON merge patch to the existing entry.

### Sample payload

```json
{
  "options": {
    "cas": 1
  },
  "data": {
    "foo": "a",
    "bar": {
      "baz": "b"
    }
  }
}
```

### Sample request

```shell-session
$ curl \
    --header "X-Vault-Token: ..." \
    --header "Content-Type: application/merge-patch+json"
    --request PATCH \
    --data @payload.json \
    https://127.0.0.1:8200/v1/secret/data/my-secret
```

### Sample response

```json
{
  "data": {
    "created_time": "2021-09-10T15:26:08.684999Z",
    "custom_metadata": {
      "owner": "jdoe",
      "mission_critical": "false"
    },
    "deletion_time": "",
    "destroyed": false,
    "version": 2
  }
}
```

## Read secret subkeys

This endpoint provides the subkeys within a secret entry that exists
at the requested path. The secret entry at this path will be retrieved
and stripped of all data by replacing underlying values of leaf keys
(i.e. non-map keys or map keys with no underlying subkeys) with `null`.

| Method | Path                                |
|:-------|:------------------------------------|
| `GET`  | `/:secret-mount-path/subkeys/:path` |

### Parameters

- `secret-mount-path` `(string: <required>)` - The path to the KV mount containing
  the secret to read, such as `secret`. This is specified as part of the URL.
- `path` `(string: <required>)` – Specifies the path of the secret to read.
  This is specified as part of the URL.
- `version` `(int: 0)` - Specifies the version to return. If not set the latest
  version is returned.
- `depth` `(int: 0)` - Specifies the deepest nesting level to provide in the output.
  The default value 0 will not impose any limit. If non-zero, keys that reside at the
  specified `depth` value will be artificially treated as leaves and will thus be `null`
  even if further underlying subkeys exist.

### Sample request

```shell-session
$ curl \
    --header "X-Vault-Token: ..." \
    https://127.0.0.1:8200/v1/secret/subkeys/my-secret?version=1
```

### Sample secret data

```json
{
  "foo": "abc",
  "bar": {
    "baz": "def"
  },
  "quux": {}
}
```

### Sample response

```json
{
  "subkeys": {
    "foo": null,
    "bar": {
      "baz": null
    },
    "quux": null
  },
  "metadata": {
    "created_time": "2021-12-14T20:28:00.773477Z",
    "custom_metadata": null,
    "deletion_time": "",
    "destroyed": false,
    "version": 1
  }
}
```

## Delete latest version of secret

This endpoint issues a soft delete of the secret's latest version at the
specified location. This marks the version as deleted and will stop it from
being returned from reads, but the underlying data will not be removed. A
delete can be undone using the `undelete` path.

| Method   | Path                 |
| :------- | :------------------- |
| `DELETE` | `/:secret-mount-path/data/:path` |

  the secret to delete, such as `secret`. This is specified as part of the URL.
- `path` `(string: <required>)` – Specifies the path of the secret to delete.
  This is specified as part of the URL.

### Sample request

```shell-session
$ curl \
    --header "X-Vault-Token: ..." \
    --request DELETE \
    https://127.0.0.1:8200/v1/secret/data/my-secret
```

## Delete secret versions

This endpoint issues a soft delete of the specified versions of the secret. This
marks the versions as deleted and will stop them from being returned from reads,
but the underlying data will not be removed. A delete can be undone using the
`undelete` path.

| Method | Path                               |

- `versions` `([]int: <required>)` - The versions to be deleted. The versioned
  data will not be deleted, but it will no longer be returned in normal get
  requests.

### Sample payload

```json
{
  "versions": [1, 2]
}
```

### Sample request

```shell-session
$ curl \
    --header "X-Vault-Token: ..." \

```

## List secrets

This endpoint returns a list of key names at the specified location. Folders are
suffixed with `/`. The input must be a folder; list on a file will not return a
value. Note that no policy-based filtering is performed on keys; do not encode
sensitive information in key names. The values themselves are not accessible via
this command. 

To list secrets for KV v2, a user must have a policy granting them the list capability on this `/metadata/` path - even if all the rest of their interactions with the KV v2 are via the `/data/` APIs. Access to at least list the `/metadata/` path should typically also be granted.

| Method | Path                                 |
|:-------|:-------------------------------------|
| `LIST` | `/:secret-mount-path/metadata/:path` |

### Parameters

- `secret-mount-path` `(string: <required>)` - The path to the KV mount containing
the secret to list, such as `secret`. This is specified as part of the URL.

### Sample request

```shell-session
$ curl \
    --header "X-Vault-Token: ..." \
    --request LIST \
    https://127.0.0.1:8200/v1/secret/metadata/my-secret
```

### Sample response

The example below shows output for a query path of `secret/` when there are
secrets at `secret/foo` and `secret/foo/bar`; note the difference in the two
entries.

```json
{
  "data": {
    "keys": ["foo", "foo/"]
  }
}
```

## Read secret metadata
