# Active Directory Secrets Engine (API)

This is the API documentation for the Vault AD secrets engine. For general
information about the usage and operation of the AD secrets engine, please see
the [Vault Active Directory documentation](/docs/secrets/ad).

This documentation assumes the AD secrets engine is enabled at the `/ad` path
in Vault. Since it is possible to enable secrets engines at any location, please
update your API calls accordingly.

## Configuration

The `config` endpoint configures the LDAP connection and binding parameters, as well as the password rotation configuration.

### Password parameters

- `ttl` `(int: "")` - The default password time-to-live in seconds. Once the ttl has passed, a password will
  be rotated the next time it's requested.
- `max_ttl` `(int: "")` - The maximum password time-to-live in seconds. No role will be allowed to set a
  custom ttl greater than the `max_ttl`.
- `password_policy` `(string: "")` - Name of the [password policy](/docs/concepts/password-policies) to use to
  generate passwords from. Mutually exclusive with `length` and `formatter`.

**Deprecated parameters**:

- `length` (string, optional) - The desired password length. Defaults to 64. Minimum is 14. Mutually exclusive
  with `password_policy`.
- `formatter` (string, optional) - Text into which the base64 password should be inserted, formatted like so:
  `mycustom{{PASSWORD}}`. Mutually exclusive with `password_policy`.

The following statement is applicable when using `length` and/or `formatter`, but not `password_policy`:

To meet Microsoft's password complexity requirements, all passwords begin with "?@09AZ" unless a `formatter` is provided.
The `formatter` is for organizations with different, custom password requirements. It allows an organization to supply
text that fulfills those requirements. `{{PASSWORD}}` must appear exactly once and can be anywhere in the text.

### Connection parameters

- `url` (string, optional) - The LDAP server to connect to. Examples: `ldaps://ldap.myorg.com`, `ldaps://ldap.myorg.com:636`. This can also be a comma-delineated list of URLs, e.g. `ldaps://ldap.myorg.com,ldaps://ldap.myorg.com:636`, in which case the servers will be tried in-order if there are errors during the connection process. Default is `ldap://127.0.0.1`.
- `request_timeout` `(integer: 90 or string: "90s")` - Timeout, in seconds, for the connection when making requests against the server before returning back an error.
- `starttls` (bool, optional) - If true, issues a `StartTLS` command after establishing an unencrypted connection.
- `insecure_tls` - (bool, optional) - If true, skips LDAP server SSL certificate verification - insecure, use with caution!
- `certificate` - (string, optional) - CA certificate to use when verifying LDAP server certificate, must be x509 PEM encoded.

### Binding parameters

- `binddn` (string, required) - Distinguished name of object to bind when performing user and group search. Example: `cn=vault,ou=Users,dc=example,dc=com`
- `bindpass` (string, required) - Password to use along with `binddn` when performing user search.
- `userdn` (string, optional) - Base DN under which to perform user search. Example: `ou=Users,dc=example,dc=com`
- `upndomain` (string, optional) - The domain (userPrincipalDomain) used to construct a UPN string for authentication. The constructed UPN will appear as `[binddn]@UPNDomain`. Example: if `upndomain=example.com` and `binddn=admin`, the UPN string `admin@example.com` will be used to login to Active Directory.

### Other parameters

- `last_rotation_tolerance` (string, optional) - Tolerance duration to use when checking the last rotation time.
  Active Directory often shows a "pwdLastSet" time after Vault's because it takes
  a while for password updates to be propagated across a large cluster. By default, if Active Directory's last rotation time is
  within 5 seconds of Vault's, Vault considers itself to have been the last entity that rotated the password. However, if it's been
  more than 5 seconds, Vault thinks that something rotated the password out-of-band, and re-rotates it so it will "know" it and be
  able to continue returning it. This may be too low for larger Active Directory clusters, and too high for smaller ones.

## Library management

The `library` endpoint configures the sets of service accounts that Vault will offer for check-out.

### Parameters

- `name` (string: "", required): The name of the set of service accounts.
- `service_account_names` (string: "", or list: [] required): The names of all the service accounts that can be
  checked out from this set. These service accounts must only be used by Vault, and may only be in one set. These
  service accounts must already exist in Active Directory.
- `ttl` (duration: "24h", optional): The maximum amount of time a single check-out lasts before Vault
  automatically checks it back in. Defaults to 24 hours. Setting it to zero reflects an unlimited lending period.
- `max_ttl` (duration: "24h", optional): The maximum amount of time a check-out last with renewal before Vault
  automatically checks it back in. Defaults to 24 hours. Setting it to zero reflects an unlimited lending period.
- `disable_check_in_enforcement` (bool: false, optional): Disable enforcing that service accounts must be
  checked in by the entity or client token that checked them out. Defaults to false.

When adding a service account to the library, Vault verifies it already exists in Active Directory.

| Method   | Path                    |
| :------- | :---------------------- |
| `LIST`   | `/ad/library`           |
| `POST`   | `/ad/library/:set_name` |
| `GET`    | `/ad/library/:set_name` |
| `DELETE` | `/ad/library/:set_name` |

### Sample Post Request

```shell-session
$ curl \
    --header "X-Vault-Token: ..." \
    --request POST \
    --data @payload.json \
    http://127.0.0.1:8200/v1/ad/library/accounting-team
```

### Sample Post Payload

```json
{
  "service_account_names": ["fizz@example.com", "buzz@example.com"],
  "ttl": "10h",
  "max_ttl": "20h",
  "disable_check_in_enforcement": false
}
```

### Sample Get Response

  "ttl": "10h",
  "max_ttl": "20h",
  "disable_check_in_enforcement": false
}
```

### Sample List Response

Performing a `LIST` on the `/ad/library` endpoint will list the names of all the sets of service accounts Vault contains.

```json
["accounting-team"]
```

## Check-out management

These endpoints help manage check-outs.

### Check a credential out

Returns a `200` if a credential is available, and a `400` if no credential is available.

- `name` (string: "", required): The name of the set of service accounts.
- `ttl` (duration: "", optional): The maximum amount of time a check-out lasts before Vault
  automatically checks it back in. Setting it to zero reflects an unlimited lending period.
  Defaults to the set's `ttl`. If the requested `ttl` is higher than the set's, the set's will be used.

| Method | Path                              |
| :----- | :-------------------------------- |
| `POST` | `/ad/library/:set_name/check-out` |

### Sample Post Request

```shell-session
$ curl \
    --header "X-Vault-Token: ..." \
    --request POST \
    --data @payload.json \
    http://127.0.0.1:8200/v1/ad/library/accounting-team/check-out
```

### Sample Post Payload

```json
{
  "ttl": "1h"
}
```

### Sample Post Response

```json
{
  "request_id": "364a17d4-e5ab-998b-ceee-b49929229e0c",
  "lease_id": "ad/library/accounting-team/check-out/aoBsaBEI4PK96VnukubvYDlZ",
  "renewable": true,
  "lease_duration": 36000,
  "data": {
    "password": "?@09QW0KZ8DSBu3deIu7XLY1NZqzwhozmMAZ6v0IcZJGOjs5GvpVMvOeW7/duls2",
    "service_account_name": "fizz@example.com"
  },
  "wrap_info": null,
  "warnings": null,
  "auth": null
}
```

### Check a credential in

By default, check-in must be called by the same entity or client token used for check-out.
To disable this behavior, use the `disable_check_in_enforcement` toggle on the library set. Or, use
the `ad/library/manage/:set_name/check-in` behavior to force check-in of the account. Access to the
"manage" endpoint should only be granted to highly privileged Vault users, like Vault operators.

If a caller attempts to check in a service account they're not authorized to check in, they will
receive an error response. If they attempt to check in a service account they _are_ authorized to
check in, but it's _already_ checked in, they will receive a successful response but the account
will not be included in the `check_ins` listed. `check_ins` shows which service accounts were checked
in _by this particular call_.

- `name` (string: "", required): The name of the set of service accounts.
- `service_account_names` (string: "", or list: [] optional): The names of all the service accounts to be
  checked in. May be omitted if only one is checked out.

```

## Rotate Root Credentials

Rotate the `bindpass` to a new one known only to Vault.

### Risks

1. When the `bindpass` is rotated, it successfully gets rotated in Active Directory but Vault can't store it so it becomes unknown.
2. If the `binddn` in use applies to more than one entity in Active Directory, root credential rotation will fail because it's unclear which entity to perform the operation for.

### Mitigating Risks

1. Always have another account that can provision a new `binddn` and `bindpass` to replace one whose password becomes unknown.
2. Ensure the `binddn` in use only applies to one entity by including all distinguished name parameters possible. For example, use `"CN=vault-ad-test,CN=Users,DC=example,DC=com"` instead of `"CN=vault-ad-test"`.

### Endpoints

| Method | Path              |
| :----- | :---------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| `GET`  | `/ad/rotate-root` | `204 (empty body) or 200 with warning` |
| `POST` | `/ad/rotate-root` | `204 (empty body) or 200 with warning` |

Generally, `rotate-root` returns a 204. However, if `rotate-root` is already in progress, it may return a 200 with a warning that root credential rotation is already in progress.

### Sample Get Request

```shell-session
$ curl \
    --header "X-Vault-Token: ..." \
    --request GET \
    http://127.0.0.1:8200/v1/ad/rotate-root
```

### Sample Post Request

```shell-session
$ curl \
    --header "X-Vault-Token: ..." \
    --request POST \
    http://127.0.0.1:8200/v1/ad/rotate-root
```

## Rotate Role Credentials

Manually rotate the password of a managed Active Directory service account.

| :----- | :--------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| `POST` | `/ad/rotate-role/:role_name` | `204 (empty body) or 200 with warning` |
