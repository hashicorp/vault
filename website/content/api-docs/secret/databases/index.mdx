# Database secrets engine (API)

This is the API documentation for the Vault Database secrets engine. For
general information about the usage and operation of the database secrets engine,
please see the
[Vault database secrets engine documentation](/vault/docs/secrets/databases).

This documentation assumes the database secrets engine is enabled at the
`/database` path in Vault. Since it is possible to enable secrets engines at any
location, please update your API calls accordingly.

## Configure connection

This endpoint configures the connection string used to communicate with the
desired database. In addition to the parameters listed here, each Database
plugin has additional, database plugin specific, parameters for this endpoint.
Please read the HTTP API for the plugin you'd wish to configure to see the full
list of additional parameters.

~> This endpoint distinguishes between `create` and `update` ACL capabilities.

| Method | Path                     |
| :----- | :----------------------- |
| `POST` | `/database/config/:name` |

### Parameters

- `name` `(string: <required>)` – Specifies the name for this database
  connection. This is specified as part of the URL.

- `plugin_name` `(string: <required>)` - Specifies the name of the plugin to use
  for this connection.

- `plugin_version` `(string: "")` - Specifies the semantic version of the plugin
  to use for this connection.

- `verify_connection` `(bool: true)` – Specifies if the connection is verified
  during initial configuration. Defaults to true.

- `allowed_roles` `(list: [])` - List of the roles allowed to use this connection.
  Defaults to empty (no roles), if contains a `*` any role can use this connection.

- `root_rotation_statements` `(list: [])` - Specifies the database statements to be
  executed to rotate the root user's credentials. See the plugin's API page for more
  information on support and formatting for this parameter.

- `password_policy` `(string: "")` - The name of the
  [password policy](/vault/docs/concepts/password-policies) to use when generating passwords
  for this database. If not specified, this will use a default policy defined as:
  20 characters with at least 1 uppercase, 1 lowercase, 1 number, and 1 dash character.

- `skip_static_role_import_rotation` `(bool: false)` – <EnterpriseAlert inline="true" />
  Specifies if a given static account's password should be rotated on creation
  of the static roles associated with this database config. This is can be
  overridden at the role-level by the static role's [skip_import_rotation](#skip_import_rotation)
  field. The default is false.

~> We highly recommended that you use a Vault-specific user rather than the admin user
in your database when configuring the plugin. This user will be used to
create/update/delete users within the database so it will need to have the appropriate
permissions to do so. If the plugin supports
[rotating the root credentials](#rotate-root-credentials), we highly recommended
you perform that action after configuring the plugin. This will change the password
of the user configured in this step. The new password will **not** be viewable by users.

### Common fields

There are several common fields that you will see across many of the database plugins.
Please reference the individual plugin documentation for details on whether these fields
are supported and any additional details about them.

- `connection_url` `(string)` - Specifies the connection string used to connect to the
  database. Some plugins use `url` rather than `connection_url`. This allows for simple
  templating of the username and password of the root user. Typically, this is done by
  including a `{{username}}`, `{{name}}`, and/or `{{password}}` field within the string.
  These fields are typically be replaced with the values in the `username` and
  `password` fields.

- `username` `(string)` - Specifies the name of the user to use as the "root" user when
  connecting to the database. This "root" user is used to create/update/delete users
  managed by these plugins, so you will need to ensure that this user has permissions to
  manipulate users appropriate to the database. This is typically used in the
  `connection_url` field via the templating directive `{{username}}` or `{{name}}`.

- `password` `(string)` - Specifies the password to use when connecting with the
  `username`. This value will not be returned by Vault when performing a read upon the
  configuration. This is typically used in the `connection_url` field via the templating
  directive `{{password}}`.

- `disable_escaping` `(boolean: false)` - Determines whether special characters in the
  username and password fields will be escaped. Useful for alternate connection string
  formats like ADO. More information regarding this parameter can be found on the
  [databases secrets engine docs.](/vault/docs/secrets/databases#disable-character-escaping)
  Defaults to `false`.

  This is specified as part of the URL.

### Sample request

```shell-session

## Create static role

This endpoint creates or updates a static role definition. Static Roles are a
1-to-1 mapping of a Vault Role to a user in a database which are automatically
rotated based on the configured `rotation_period` or `rotation_schedule`.

~> This endpoint distinguishes between `create` and `update` ACL capabilities.

~> Vault will rotate the password when creating a static role. Vault must do
this in order to know the password.

| Method | Path                           |
| :----- | :----------------------------- |
| `POST` | `/database/static-roles/:name` |

### Parameters

- `name` `(string: <required>)` – Specifies the name of the role to create. This
  is specified as part of the URL.

- `username` `(string: <required>)` – Specifies the database username that this
  Vault role corresponds to.

- `password` `(string)` – <EnterpriseAlert product="vault" inline />
  The password corresponding to the username in the database. Required when using
  the Rootless Password Rotation workflow or the Skip Automatic Import Rotation
  workflow for static roles.

- `self_managed_password` `(string)` – <EnterpriseAlert product="vault" inline />
  The password corresponding to the username in the database. Required when using
  the Rootless Password Rotation workflow for static roles. Only enabled for select
  DB engines (Postgres). This parameter is deprecated in favor of `password`.

- `db_name` `(string: <required>)` - The name of the database connection to use
  for this role.

- `rotation_period` `(string/int)` – Specifies the amount of time Vault should
  wait before rotating the password. The minimum is 5 seconds.  Uses [duration
  format strings](/vault/docs/concepts/duration-format). Mutually exclusive
  with `rotation_schedule`.

- `rotation_schedule` `(string)` – A cron-style string that will define the
  schedule on which rotations should occur. This should be a "standard"
  [cron-style](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron) string made of five fields
  of which each entry defines the minute, hour, day of month, month, and day of
  week respectively. For example, a value of `0 0 * * SAT` will set rotations
  to occur on Saturday at 00:00. Mutually exclusive with `rotation_period`.

  ~> **Warning**: The `rotation_period` and `rotation_schedule` fields are
  mutually exclusive. One of them must be set but not both.

- `rotation_window` `(string/int)` – Specifies the amount of time in which the
  rotation is allowed to occur starting from a given `rotation_schedule`. If
  the credential is not rotated during this window, due to a failure or
  otherwise, it will not be rotated until the next scheduled rotation. The
  minimum is 1 hour. Uses [duration format strings](/vault/docs/concepts/duration-format).
  Optional when `rotation_schedule` is set and disallowed when `rotation_period`
  is set.

- `rotation_statements` `(list: [])` – Specifies the database statements to be
  executed to rotate the password for the configured database user. Not every
  plugin type will support this functionality. See the plugin's API page for
  more information on support and formatting for this parameter.

- `skip_import_rotation` `(bool: false)` – <EnterpriseAlert inline="true" />
  Specifies if the static account's password should be rotated on creation of
  the static role. This overrides the config-level field
  [skip_static_role_import_rotation](#skip_static_role_import_rotation). The
  default is false.
