# PKI Secrets Engine (API)

This is the API documentation for the Vault PKI secrets engine. For general
information about the usage and operation of the PKI secrets engine, please see
the [PKI documentation](/docs/secrets/pki).

This documentation assumes the PKI secrets engine is enabled at the `/pki` path
in Vault. Since it is possible to enable secrets engines at any location, please
update your API calls accordingly.

## Notice About New Multi-Issuer Functionality

Vault since 1.11.0 allows a single PKI mount to have multiple Certificate
Authority (CA) certificates ("issuers") in a single mount, for the purpose
of facilitating rotation. All issuers within a single mount are treated as a
single Authority, meaning that:

 1. Certificate Revocation List (CRL) configuration is common to all issuers,
 2. All authority access URLs are common to all issuers,
 3. Issued certificates' serial numbers will be unique across all issuers.

However, since each issuer may have a distinct subject and keys, different
issuers may have different CRLs.

It is _strongly_ encouraged to limit the scope of CAs within a mount and not
to mix different types of CAs (roots and intermediates).

~> **Note**: Some functionality will not work if a default issuer is not
   configured. Vault automatically selects the default issuer from the
   current issuing certificate on migration from an older Vault version
   (Vault < 1.11.0).

## Issuing Certificates

The following API endpoints allow users or operators to request certificates
and are all authenticated.

In general, for self-serve use, the `/pki/sign/:name` and `/pki/issue/:name`
are sufficient to allow most users to access for ACL purposes. The per-issuer
variants (`/pki/issuer/:issuer_ref/sign/:name` and
`/pki/issuer/:issuer_ref/issue/:name`) allow the requester to override the
role's chosen issuer, potentially allowing users to request certificates
issued by the wrong parent authority.

Some API endpoints included here are privileged and should only be accessed
by trusted users or operators; these include the various `sign-verbatim`,
`sign-self-signed` and `sign-intermediate` endpoints.

If an issued certificate has been compromised, it should be revoked. The
Vault PKI secrets engine presently only allows revocation by serial number;
because this could allow users to deny access to other users, it should be
restricted to operators.

### List Roles

This endpoint returns a list of available roles. Only the role names are
returned, not any values. It is useful to both operators and users.

| Method | Path         |
| :----- | :----------- |
| `LIST` | `/pki/roles` |

#### Sample Request

```shell-session
$ curl \
    --header "X-Vault-Token: ..." \
    --request LIST \
    http://127.0.0.1:8200/v1/pki/roles
```

#### Sample Response

```json
{
  "auth": null,
  "data": {
    "keys": ["dev", "prod"]
  },
  "lease_duration": 0,
  "lease_id": "",
  "renewable": false
}
```

### Read Role

This endpoint queries the role definition. It is useful to both operators and
users.

| Method | Path               |
| :----- | :----------------- |
| `GET`  | `/pki/roles/:name` |

#### Parameters

- `name` `(string: <required>)` - Specifies the name of the role to read. This
  is part of the request URL.

#### Sample Request

```shell-session
$ curl \
    --header "X-Vault-Token: ..." \
    http://127.0.0.1:8200/v1/pki/roles/my-role
```

#### Sample Response

```json
{
  "data": {
    "allow_any_name": false,
    "allow_ip_sans": true,
    "allow_localhost": true,
    "allow_subdomains": false,
    "allowed_domains": ["example.com", "foobar.com"],
    "allowed_uri_sans": ["example.com", "spiffe://*"],
    "allowed_other_sans": [
      "1.3.6.1.4.1.311.20.2.3;utf8:devops@example.com",
      "1.3.6.1.4.1.311.20.2.4;UTF-8:*"
    ],
    "client_flag": true,
    "code_signing_flag": false,
    "key_bits": 2048,
    "key_type": "rsa",
    "ttl": "6h",
    "max_ttl": "12h",
    "server_flag": true,
    ... additional fields elided ...
  }
}
```

### Generate Certificate and Key

This endpoint generates a new set of credentials (private key and certificate)
based on the role named in the endpoint. The issuing CA certificate and full CA
chain is returned as well, so that only the root CA need be in a client's trust
store. Choice of issuing CA is determined first by the role (when using the
`/pki/issue/:name` path) and then by the path (when using the
`/pki/issuer/:issuer_ref/issue/name` path).

It is suggested to limit access to the path-overridden issue endpoint (on
`/pki/issuer/:issuer_ref/issue/:name`).

~> **Note**: The private key is _not_ stored. If you do not save the private
   key from the response, you will need to request a new certificate.

| Method | Path                                  | Issuer        |
| :----- | :------------------------------------ | :------------ |
| `POST` | `/pki/issue/:name`                    | Role selected |
| `POST` | `/pki/issuer/:issuer_ref/issue/:name` | Path selected |

#### Parameters

- `name` `(string: <required>)` - Specifies the name of the role to create the
  certificate against. This is part of the request URL.

- `issuer_ref` `(string: <required>)` - Reference to an existing issuer,
  either by Vault-generated identifier, the literal string `default` to
  refer to the currently configured default issuer, or the name assigned
  to an issuer. This parameter is part of the request URL.

~> Note: This parameter is not present on the `/pki/issue/:name` path and
   takes its value from the role's `issuer_ref` field.

- `common_name` `(string: <required>)` - Specifies the requested CN for the
  certificate. If the CN is allowed by role policy, it will be issued. If more
  than one `common_name` is desired, specify the alternative names in the
  `alt_names` list.

- `alt_names` `(string: "")` - Specifies requested Subject Alternative Names, in
  a comma-delimited list. These can be host names or email addresses; they will
  be parsed into their respective fields. If any requested names do not match
  role policy, the entire request will be denied.

- `ip_sans` `(string: "")` - Specifies requested IP Subject Alternative Names,
  in a comma-delimited list. Only valid if the role allows IP SANs (which is the
  default).

- `uri_sans` `(string: "")` - Specifies the requested URI Subject Alternative
  Names, in a comma-delimited list. If any requested URIs do not match role policy,
  the entire request will be denied.

- `other_sans` `(string: "")` - Specifies custom OID/UTF8-string SANs. These
  must match values specified on the role in `allowed_other_sans` (see role
  creation for allowed_other_sans globbing rules).
  The format is the same as OpenSSL: `<oid>;<type>:<value>` where the
  only current valid type is `UTF8`. This can be a comma-delimited list or a
  JSON string slice.

- `ttl` `(string: "")` - Specifies requested Time To Live. Cannot be greater
  than the role's `max_ttl` value. If not provided, the role's `ttl` value will
  be used. Note that the role values default to system values if not explicitly
  set. See `not_after` as an alternative for setting an absolute end date
  (rather than a relative one).

- `format` `(string: "pem")` - Specifies the format for returned data. Can be
  `pem`, `der`, or `pem_bundle`; defaults to `pem`. If `der`, the output is
  base64 encoded. If `pem_bundle`, the `certificate` field will contain the
  private key and certificate, concatenated; if the issuing CA is not a
  Vault-derived self-signed root, this will be included as well.

- `private_key_format` `(string: "der")` - Specifies the format for marshaling the
  private key. Defaults to `der` which will return either base64-encoded DER or
  PEM-encoded DER, depending on the value of `format`. The other option is
  `pkcs8` which will return the key marshalled as PEM-encoded PKCS8.

- `exclude_cn_from_sans` `(bool: false)` - If true, the given `common_name` will
  not be included in DNS or Email Subject Alternate Names (as appropriate).
  Useful if the CN is not a hostname or email address, but is instead some
  human-readable identifier.

- `not_after` `(string)` - Set the Not After field of the certificate with
  specified date value. The value format should be given in UTC format
  `YYYY-MM-ddTHH:MM:SSZ`. Supports the Y10K end date for IEEE 802.1AR-2018
  standard devices, `9999-12-31T23:59:59Z`.

### Sign Certificate

This endpoint signs a new certificate based upon the provided CSR and the
supplied parameters, subject to the restrictions contained in the role named in
the endpoint. The issuing CA certificate and the full CA chain is returned as
well, so that only the root CA need be in a client's trust store.

It is suggested to limit access to the path-overridden sign endpoint (on
`/pki/issuer/:issuer_ref/sign/:name`).

| Method | Path                                 | Issuer        |
| :----- | :----------------------------------- | :------------ |
| `POST` | `/pki/sign/:name`                    | Role selected |

  either by Vault-generated identifier, the literal string `default` to
  refer to the currently configured default issuer, or the name assigned
  to an issuer. This parameter is part of the request URL.

~> Note: This parameter is not present on the `/pki/sign/:name` path and
   takes its value from the role's `issuer_ref` field.

- `csr` `(string: <required>)` - Specifies the PEM-encoded CSR.

- `common_name` `(string: <required>)` - Specifies the requested CN for the
  certificate. If the CN is allowed by role policy, it will be issued. If
  more than one `common_name` is desired, specify the alternative names in
  the `alt_names` list.

- `alt_names` `(string: "")` - Specifies the requested Subject Alternative
  Names, in a comma-delimited list. These can be host names or email addresses;
  they will be parsed into their respective fields. If any requested names do
  not match role policy, the entire request will be denied.

- `other_sans` `(string: "")` - Specifies custom OID/UTF8-string SANs. These
  must match values specified on the role in `allowed_other_sans` (see role
  creation for allowed_other_sans globbing rules).
  The format is the same as OpenSSL: `<oid>;<type>:<value>` where the
  only current valid type is `UTF8`. This can be a comma-delimited list or a
  JSON string slice.

- `ip_sans` `(string: "")` - Specifies the requested IP Subject Alternative
  Names, in a comma-delimited list. Only valid if the role allows IP SANs (which
  is the default).

- `uri_sans` `(string: "")` - Specifies the requested URI Subject Alternative
  Names, in a comma-delimited list. If any requested URIs do not match role policy,
  the entire request will be denied.

```

### Sign Intermediate

This endpoint uses the configured CA certificate to issue a certificate with
appropriate values for acting as an intermediate CA. Distribution points use the
values set via `config/urls`. Values set in the CSR are ignored unless
`use_csr_values` is set to true, in which case the values from the CSR are used
verbatim.

This endpoint can be used both when signing a Vault-backed intermediate or
when signing an externally-owned intermediate.

~> **Note**: This is a privileged endpoint, as callers are granted a new
   intermediate certificate, with which they can issue for arbitrary names.
   Access to this endpoint should be restricted by policy to only trusted
   operators.

| Method | Path                                        | Issuer    |
| :----- | :------------------------------------------ | :-------  |
| `POST` | `/pki/root/sign-intermediate`               | `default` |
| `POST` | `/pki/issuer/:issuer_ref/sign-intermediate` | Selected  |

#### Parameters

- `issuer_ref` `(string: <required>)` - Reference to an existing issuer,
  either by Vault-generated identifier, the literal string `default` to
  refer to the currently configured default issuer, or the name assigned
  to an issuer. This parameter is part of the request URL.

~> Note: This parameter is not present on the `/pki/root/sign-intermediate`
   path and takes the value `default`.

- `csr` `(string: <required>)` - Specifies the PEM-encoded CSR to be signed.

- `common_name` `(string: <required>)` - Specifies the requested CN for the
  certificate. If more than one `common_name` is desired, specify the
  alternative names in the `alt_names` list.

- `alt_names` `(string: "")` - Specifies the requested Subject Alternative
  Names, in a comma-delimited list. These can be host names or email addresses;
  they will be parsed into their respective fields.

- `ip_sans` `(string: "")` - Specifies the requested IP Subject Alternative
  Names, in a comma-delimited list.

- `uri_sans` `(string: "")` - Specifies the requested URI Subject Alternative
  Names, in a comma-delimited list.

- `other_sans` `(string: "")` - Specifies custom OID/UTF8-string SANs. These
  must match values specified on the role in `allowed_other_sans` (see role
  creation for allowed_other_sans globbing rules).
  The format is the same as OpenSSL: `<oid>;<type>:<value>` where the
  only current valid type is `UTF8`. This can be a comma-delimited list or a
  JSON string slice.

- `ttl` `(string: "")` - Specifies the requested Time To Live (after which the
  certificate will be expired). This cannot be larger than the engine's max (or,
  if not set, the system max). However, this can be after the expiration of the
  signing CA. See `not_after` as an alternative for setting an absolute end date
  (rather than a relative one).

- `format` `(string: "pem")` - Specifies the format for returned data. Can be
  `pem`, `der`, or `pem_bundle`. If `der`, the output is base64 encoded. If
  `pem_bundle`, the `certificate` field will contain the certificate and, if the
  issuing CA is not a Vault-derived self-signed root, it will be concatenated
  with the certificate.

- `max_path_length` `(int: -1)` - Specifies the maximum path length to encode in
  the generated certificate. `-1`, means no limit, unless the signing
  certificate has a maximum path length set, in which case the path length is
  set to one less than that of the signing certificate. A limit of `0` means a
  literal path length of zero.

- `exclude_cn_from_sans` `(bool: false)` - If true, the given `common_name` will
  not be included in DNS or Email Subject Alternate Names (as appropriate).
  Useful if the CN is not a hostname or email address, but is instead some
  human-readable identifier.

- `use_csr_values` `(bool: false)` - If set to `true`, then: 1) Subject
  information, including names and alternate names, will be preserved from the
  CSR rather than using the values provided in the other parameters to this
  path; 2) Any key usages (for instance, non-repudiation) requested in the CSR
  will be added to the basic set of key usages used for CA certs signed by this
  path; 3) Extensions requested in the CSR will be copied into the issued
  certificate.

- `permitted_dns_domains` `(string: "")` - A comma separated string (or, string
  array) containing DNS domains for which certificates are allowed to be issued
  or signed by this CA certificate. Supports subdomains via a `.` in front of
  the domain, as per
  [RFC](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5280#section-4.2.1.10).

- `ou` `(string: "")` - Specifies the OU (OrganizationalUnit) values in the
  subject field of the resulting certificate. This is a comma-separated string
  or JSON array.

- `organization` `(string: "")` - Specifies the O (Organization) values in the
  subject field of the resulting certificate. This is a comma-separated string
  or JSON array.

- `country` `(string: "")` - Specifies the C (Country) values in the subject
  field of the resulting certificate. This is a comma-separated string or JSON
  array.

- `locality` `(string: "")` - Specifies the L (Locality) values in the subject
  field of the resulting certificate. This is a comma-separated string or JSON
  array.

- `province` `(string: "")` - Specifies the ST (Province) values in the subject
  field of the resulting certificate. This is a comma-separated string or JSON
  array.

- `street_address` `(string: "")` - Specifies the Street Address values in the
  subject field of the resulting certificate. This is a comma-separated string
  or JSON array.

- `postal_code` `(string: "")` - Specifies the Postal Code values in the
  subject field of the resulting certificate. This is a comma-separated string
  or JSON array.

- `serial_number` `(string: "")` -  - Specifies the requested Subject's named
  [Serial Number](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4519#section-2.31)
  value, if any. If you want more than one, specify alternative names in the
  `alt_names` map using OID 2.5.4.5. Note that this has no impact on the
  Certificate's serial number field, which Vault randomly generates.

- `not_after` `(string)` - Set the Not After field of the certificate with
  specified date value. The value format should be given in UTC format
  `YYYY-MM-ddTHH:MM:SSZ`. Supports the Y10K end date for IEEE 802.1AR-2018
  standard devices, `9999-12-31T23:59:59Z`.

### Sign Self-Issued

This endpoint uses the configured CA certificate to sign a self-issued
certificate (which will usually be a self-signed certificate as well).

~> **_This is an extremely privileged endpoint_**. The given certificate will be
   signed as-is with only minimal validation performed (is it a CA cert, and is it
   actually self-issued). The only values that will be changed will be the
   authority key ID, the issuer DN, and, if set, any distribution points.<br /><br />
   It is recommended to limit this endpoint to only trusted operators.

This is generally only needed for root certificate rolling in cases where you
don't want/can't get access to a CSR (such as if it's a root stored in Vault
where the key is not exposed). If you don't know whether you need this
endpoint, you most likely should be using a different endpoint (such as
`sign-intermediate`).

| Method | Path                                       | Issuer    | Requires `sudo` capability |
| :----- | :----------------------------------------- | :-------- | :------------------------- |
| `POST` | `/pki/root/sign-self-issued`               | `default` | yes                        |
| `POST` | `/pki/issuer/:issuer_ref/sign-self-issued` | Selected  | no                         |

#### Parameters

- `issuer_ref` `(string: <required>)` - Reference to an existing issuer,
  either by Vault-generated identifier, the literal string `default` to
  refer to the currently configured default issuer, or the name assigned
  to an issuer. This parameter is part of the request URL.

~> Note: This parameter is not present on the `/pki/root/sign-self-issued`
   path and takes the value `default`.

- `certificate` `(string: <required>)` - Specifies the PEM-encoded self-issued certificate.

- `require_matching_certificate_algorithms` `(bool: false)` - If true, requires
that the public key algorithm of the CA match that of the submitted certificate.

#### Sample Payload

```json
{
  "certificate": "..."
}
```

#### Sample Request

```shell-session
$ curl \
    --header "X-Vault-Token: ..." \
    --request POST \
    --data @payload.json \
    http://127.0.0.1:8200/v1/pki/root/sign-self-issued

  },
  "auth": null
}
```

### Sign Verbatim

This endpoint signs a new certificate based upon the provided CSR. Values are
taken verbatim from the CSR; the _only_ restriction is that this endpoint will
refuse to issue an intermediate CA certificate (see the
`/pki/root/sign-intermediate` endpoint for that functionality.)

**This is a potentially dangerous endpoint and only highly trusted users should
have access.**

| Method | Path                                            | Issuer    |
| :----- | :---------------------------------------------- | :-------- |
| `POST` | `/pki/sign-verbatim(/:name)`                    | `default` |
| `POST` | `/pki/issuer/:issuer_ref/sign-verbatim(/:name)` | Selected  |

#### Parameters

- `issuer_ref` `(string: <required>)` - Reference to an existing issuer,
  either by Vault-generated identifier, the literal string `default` to
  refer to the currently configured default issuer, or the name assigned
  to an issuer. This parameter is part of the request URL.

~> Note: This parameter is not present on the `/pki/root/sign-self-issued`
   path and takes the value `default`.

- `name` `(string: "")` - Specifies a role. If set, the following parameters
  from the role will have effect: `ttl`, `max_ttl`, `generate_lease`, `no_store` and `not_before_duration`.

- `csr` `(string: <required>)` - Specifies the PEM-encoded CSR.

- `key_usage` `(list: ["DigitalSignature", "KeyAgreement", "KeyEncipherment"])` -
  Specifies the allowed key usage constraint on issued certificates. Valid
  values can be found at https://golang.org/pkg/crypto/x509/#KeyUsage - simply
  drop the `KeyUsage` part of the value. Values are not case-sensitive. To
  specify no key usage constraints, set this to an empty list.

- `ext_key_usage` `(list: [])` -
  Specifies the allowed extended key usage constraint on issued certificates. Valid
  values can be found at https://golang.org/pkg/crypto/x509/#ExtKeyUsage - simply
  drop the `ExtKeyUsage` part of the value. Values are not case-sensitive. To
  specify no key usage constraints, set this to an empty list.

- `ext_key_usage_oids` `(string: "")` - A comma-separated string or list of extended key usage oids.

- `ttl` `(string: "")` - Specifies the requested Time To Live. Cannot be greater
  than the engine's `max_ttl` value. If not provided, the engine's `ttl` value
  will be used, which defaults to system values if not explicitly set. See
  `not_after` as an alternative for setting an absolute end date (rather than
  a relative one).

- `format` `(string: "pem")` - Specifies the format for returned data. Can be
  `pem`, `der`, or `pem_bundle`. If `der`, the output is base64 encoded. If
  `pem_bundle`, the `certificate` field will contain the certificate and, if the
  issuing CA is not a Vault-derived self-signed root, it will be concatenated
  with the certificate.

- `not_after` `(string)` - Set the Not After field of the certificate with
  specified date value. The value format should be given in UTC format
  `YYYY-MM-ddTHH:MM:SSZ`. Supports the Y10K end date for IEEE 802.1AR-2018
  standard devices, `9999-12-31T23:59:59Z`.

### Revoke Certificate

This endpoint revokes a certificate using its serial number. This is an
alternative option to the standard method of revoking using Vault lease IDs. A
successful revocation will rotate the CRL.

~> **Note**: This operation is privileged as it allows revocation of arbitrary
   certificates based purely on their serial number. It does not validate that
   the requesting user issued the certificate or has possession of the private
   key.<br /><br />
   It is not possible to revoke issuers using this path.

| Method | Path          |
| :----- | :------------ |
| `POST` | `/pki/revoke` |

#### Parameters

- `serial_number` `(string: <required>)` - Specifies the serial number of the
  certificate to revoke, in hyphen-separated or colon-separated hexadecimal.

#### Sample Payload

```json
{
  "serial_number": "39:dd:2e..."
}
```

#### Sample Request

```shell-session
$ curl \
    --header "X-Vault-Token: ..." \
    --request POST \
    --data @payload.json \
    http://127.0.0.1:8200/v1/pki/revoke
```

#### Sample Response

```json
{
  "data": {
    "revocation_time": 1433269787
  }
}
```

## Accessing Authority Information

All consumers of the PKI Secrets Engine mount point will have access to the
following unauthenticated APIs, useful for reading information about the
certificate authority in this mount point.

This includes information about [CA certificates](#read-issuer-certificate),
[their chains](#read-default-issuer-certificate-chain), and [their signed
CRLs](#read-issuer-crl), containing an encoded list of revoked certificates
previously issued by this authority. Individual issued [certificates can
also be read](#read-certificate), assuming their serial number is known.
Finally, the list of issuing certificates is public information in this
mount.

However, the endpoint for [listing all issuers](#list-issuers) in this
mount is authenticated, though not generally considered privileged
information from a PKI perspective; organizations may choose to lock
this down as they see fit.

### List Issuers

This endpoint returns a list of issuers currently provisioned in this mount.
The response includes both the issuer's identifier as well as the name chosen
by the operators; either can be used to refer to the issuer later.

This endpoint is unauthenticated.

| Method | Path           |
| :----- | :------------- |
| `LIST` | `/pki/issuers` |

#### Sample Request

```shell-session
$ curl \
    --request LIST \
    http://127.0.0.1:8200/v1/pki/issuers
```

#### Sample Response

```json
{
  "data": {
    "key_info": {

    ]
  }
}
```

### Read Issuer Certificate

This endpoint retrieves the specified issuer's certificate.

Note that the response differs between the older `/pki/cert/ca`
path and the newer `/pki/issuer/:issuer_ref/json` path; the latter
includes the full `ca_chain` of the issuer, removing the need for a separate
endpoint.

These are unauthenticated endpoints.

| Method | Path                           | Issuer    | Format                                                                            |
| :----- | :----------------------------- | :-------- |:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

| `GET`  | `/pki/issuer/:issuer_ref/pem`  | Selected  | PEM [\[1\]](#vault-cli-with-der-pem-responses "Vault CLI With DER/PEM Responses") |

#### Parameters

- `issuer_ref` `(string: <required>)` - Reference to an existing issuer,
  either by Vault-generated identifier, the literal string `default` to
  refer to the currently configured default issuer, or the name assigned
  to an issuer. This parameter is part of the request URL.

~> Note: This parameter is not present on the `/pki/cert/ca` and
   `/pki/ca(/pem)?` paths and takes the implicit value `default`.

#### Sample Request

```shell-session
$ curl \
    http://127.0.0.1:8200/v1/pki/issuer/root-x1/json
```

#### Sample Response

```text

    "revocation_time": 0
  }
}
```

<a name="read-ca-certificate-chain"></a>

### Read Default Issuer Certificate Chain

This endpoint retrieves the default issuer's CA certificate chain, including
the default issuer.

To read [other issuers' chains](#read-issuer-certificate), use the
`/pki/issuer/:issuer_ref/json` endpoint instead.

These are unauthenticated endpoints.

| Method | Path                 | Issuer    | Format                                                                            |
| :----- | :------------------- | :-------- |:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `GET`  | `/pki/ca_chain`      | `default` | PEM [\[1\]](#vault-cli-with-der-pem-responses "Vault CLI With DER/PEM Responses") |
| `GET`  | `/pki/cert/ca_chain` | `default` | JSON                                                                              |

~> **Note**: As of Vault 1.11.0, these endpoints now return the full chain
   (including the default issuer's certificate and all parent issuers known
   to Vault) in these responses.

#### Sample Request

```shell-session
$ curl \
    http://127.0.0.1:8200/v1/pki/ca_chain
```

#### Sample Response

```text
<PEM-encoded certificate chain>
```

<a name="read-crl"></a>

### Read Issuer CRL

This endpoint retrieves the specified issuer's CRL.

Note that the response differs between the older `/pki/cert/crl` path and
the newer `/pki/issuer/:issuer_ref/crl` path; the latter correctly places the
PEM-encoded CRL in the `crl` field whereas the former incorrectly places it
in the `certificate` field.

These are unauthenticated endpoints.

~> **Note**: As of Vault 1.11.0, these endpoints now serve a [version 2](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5280#section-5.1.2.1) CRL response.

| Method | Path                              | Issuer    | Format                                                                            |

| `GET`  | `/pki/crl`                        | `default` | DER [\[1\]](#vault-cli-with-der-pem-responses "Vault CLI With DER/PEM Responses") |
| `GET`  | `/pki/crl/pem`                    | `default` | PEM [\[1\]](#vault-cli-with-der-pem-responses "Vault CLI With DER/PEM Responses") |
| `GET`  | `/pki/issuer/:issuer_ref/crl`     | Selected  | JSON                                                                              |
| `GET`  | `/pki/issuer/:issuer_ref/crl/der` | Selected  | DER [\[1\]](#vault-cli-with-der-pem-responses "Vault CLI With DER/PEM Responses") |
| `GET`  | `/pki/issuer/:issuer_ref/crl/pem` | Selected  | PEM [\[1\]](#vault-cli-with-der-pem-responses "Vault CLI With DER/PEM Responses") |

#### Parameters

- `issuer_ref` `(string: <required>)` - Reference to an existing issuer,
  either by Vault-generated identifier, the literal string `default` to
  refer to the currently configured default issuer, or the name assigned
  to an issuer. This parameter is part of the request URL.

~> Note: This parameter is not present on the `/pki/cert/crl` and
   `/pki/crl(/pem)?` paths and takes the implicit value `default`.

#### Sample Request

```shell-session
$ curl \
    http://127.0.0.1:8200/v1/pki/issuer/root-x1/crl
```

#### Sample Response

```json
{
  "data": {
    "crl": "-----BEGIN X509 CRL-----\nMIIBizB1AgEBMA0GCSqGSIb3DQEBCwUAMBIxEDAOBgNVBAMTB3Jvb3QgeDEXDTIy\n..."
  }
}
```

### List Certificates

This endpoint returns a list of the current certificates by serial number only.
The response does not include the [special serial numbers](#read-certificate-serial-param-values)
(`ca`, `ca_chain`, and `crl`) that can be used with `/pki/cert/:serial`.

~> Note: The endpoint to list all certificates is authenticated. This is to
   prevent automated enumeration of issued certificates for internal services;
   however, this information should generally be considered non-sensitive and
   the certificates themselves are exposed without authentication (provided
   their serial number is known).<br /><br />
   Many Public CAs participate in the Certificate Transparency initiative,
   where all issued certificates are publicly disclosed in the interest
   of third-party verification of CA integrity.

| Method | Path         |
| :----- | :----------- |
| `LIST` | `/pki/certs` |

#### Sample Request

```shell-session
$ curl \
    --header "X-Vault-Token: ..." \
    --request LIST \
    http://127.0.0.1:8200/v1/pki/certs
```

#### Sample Response

```json

    ]
  }
}
```

<a name="read-raw-certificate"></a>

### Read Certificate

This endpoint retrieves the certificate specified by its serial number,
including issued certificates.

~> Note: With the exception of the special values (`ca`, `crl`, and
   `ca_chain`), `/pki/cert/:serial` will return different results on
   different clusters. This is because stored certificates are not
   replicated across different Performance Replication clusters.

These are unauthenticated endpoints.

| Method | Path                        | Format                                                                            |
| :----- | :-------------------------- |:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `GET`  | `/pki/cert/:serial`         | JSON                                                                              |
| `GET`  | `/pki/cert/:serial/raw`     | DER [\[1\]](#vault-cli-with-der-pem-responses "Vault CLI With DER/PEM Responses") |
| `GET`  | `/pki/cert/:serial/raw/pem` | PEM [\[1\]](#vault-cli-with-der-pem-responses "Vault CLI With DER/PEM Responses") |

#### Parameters

- `serial` `(string: <required>)` - Specifies the serial of the key to read.
  This is part of the request URL. Valid values for `serial` are:

<a name="read-certificate-serial-param-values"></a>

  - `<serial>` for the certificate with the given serial number, in hyphen-separated or colon-separated hexadecimal.
  - `ca` for the _default_ issuer's CA certificate
  - `crl` for the _default_ issuer's CRL
  - `ca_chain` for the _default_ issuer's CA trust chain.

~> **Note**: As of Vault 1.11.0, these endpoints return the full chain
   (including this certificate and all parent issuers known to Vault) in
   the `ca_chain` response, for both the `certificate` and newer `ca_chain`
   fields. The root certificate is no longer elided.

#### Sample Request

```shell-session
$ curl \
    http://127.0.0.1:8200/v1/pki/cert/67:b4:f7:2c:aa:ef:b9:30:f6:ae:f5:12:21:79:ac:08:8a:86:89:72

    "certificate": "-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----\nMIIGmDCCBYCgAwIBAgIHBzEB3fTzhTANBgkqhkiG9w0BAQsFADCBjDELMAkGA1UE\n..."
  }
}
```

## Managing Keys and Issuers

The following endpoints are highly privileged and allow operators to generate
or import new issuer certificates and keys, remove existing keys and issuers,
or read internal information about keys and issuers.

### List Issuers

Refer to the [earlier section](#list-issuers) for more information about
listing issuers.

### List Keys

This endpoint returns a list of keys currently provisioned in this mount.
The response includes both the key's identifier as well as the name chosen
by the operators; either can be used to refer to the key later.

This endpoint is authenticated.

| Method | Path         |
| :----- | :----------- |
| `LIST` | `/pki/keys`  |

#### Sample Request

```shell-session
$ curl \
    --header "X-Vault-Token: ..." \
    --request LIST \
    http://127.0.0.1:8200/v1/pki/keys
```

#### Sample Response

```json
{
  "data": {
    "key_info": {
      "f9244f54-adc7-4a5c-6b08-6ca3a3325620": {
        "key_name": "imported-root-key"
      },
    },
    "keys": [
      "f9244f54-adc7-4a5c-6b08-6ca3a3325620",
    ]
  }
}
```

### Generate Root

This endpoint generates a new self-signed CA certificate and private key. If
the path ends with `exported`, the private key will be returned in the
response; if it is `internal` the private key will not be returned and _cannot
be retrieved later_; if it is `existing`, the key specified by `key_ref` will
be reused for this root; if it is `kms`, a [managed keys](#managed-keys) will
be used.

This generated root will sign its own CRL. Authority Access distribution points
use the values set via `config/urls`.

~> **Note**: As of Vault 1.11.0, the PKI Secrets Engine now supports multiple
   issuers under a single mount. Use the management operations in this section
   to [list](#list-issuers) and [modify issuers](#update-issuer) within this
   mount. No issuers will be overridden by calling this operation. Deleting
   individual keys and issuers should be preferred to calling `DELETE /pki/root`,
   [which deletes everything](#delete-all-issuers-and-keys).

| Method | Path                               |
| :----- | :--------------------------------- |
| `POST` | `/pki/root/generate/:type`         |
| `POST` | `/pki/issuers/generate/root/:type` |

#### Parameters

- `type` `(string: <required>)` - Specifies the type of the root to
  create. If `exported`, the private key will be returned in the response; if
  `internal` the private key will not be returned and _cannot be retrieved
  later_; if `existing`, we use the value of the `key_ref` parameter to find
  existing key material to create the CSR; `kms` is also supported: [see below
  for more details about managed keys](#managed-keys). This parameter is part
  of the request URL.

- `common_name` `(string: <required>)` - Specifies the requested CN for the
  certificate. If more than one `common_name` is desired, specify the
  alternative names in the `alt_names` list.

- `alt_names` `(string: "")` - Specifies the requested Subject Alternative
  Names, in a comma-delimited list. These can be host names or email addresses;
  they will be parsed into their respective fields.

- `ip_sans` `(string: "")` - Specifies the requested IP Subject Alternative
  Names, in a comma-delimited list.

- `uri_sans` `(string: "")` - Specifies the requested URI Subject Alternative
  Names, in a comma-delimited list.

- `other_sans` `(string: "")` - Specifies custom OID/UTF8-string SANs. These
  must match values specified on the role in `allowed_other_sans` (see role
  creation for allowed_other_sans globbing rules).
  The format is the same as OpenSSL: `<oid>;<type>:<value>` where the
  only current valid type is `UTF8`. This can be a comma-delimited list or a
  JSON string slice.

- `ttl` `(string: "")` - Specifies the requested Time To Live (after which the
  certificate will be expired). This cannot be larger than the engine's max (or,
  if not set, the system max). See `not_after` as an alternative for setting an
  absolute end date (rather than a relative one).

- `format` `(string: "pem")` - Specifies the format for returned data. Can be
  `pem`, `der`, or `pem_bundle`. If `der`, the output is base64 encoded. If
  `pem_bundle`, the `certificate` field will contain the private key (if
  exported) and certificate, concatenated; if the issuing CA is not a
  Vault-derived self-signed root, this will be included as well.

- `private_key_format` `(string: "der")` - Specifies the format for marshaling the
  private key. Defaults to `der` which will return either base64-encoded DER or
  PEM-encoded DER, depending on the value of `format`. The other option is
  `pkcs8` which will return the key marshalled as PEM-encoded PKCS8.

- `key_type` `(string: "rsa")` - Specifies the desired key type; must be `rsa`, `ed25519`
  or `ec`.

~> **Note**: In FIPS 140-2 mode, the following algorithms are not certified
   and thus should not be used: `ed25519`.

- `key_bits` `(int: 0)` - Specifies the number of bits to use for the
  generated keys. Allowed values are 0 (universal default); with
  `key_type=rsa`, allowed values are: 2048 (default), 3072, or
  4096; with `key_type=ec`, allowed values are: 224, 256 (default),
  384, or 521; ignored with `key_type=ed25519`.

- `max_path_length` `(int: -1)` - Specifies the maximum path length to encode in
  the generated certificate. `-1` means no limit. Unless the signing certificate
  has a maximum path length set, in which case the path length is set to one
  less than that of the signing certificate. A limit of `0` means a literal
  path length of zero.

- `exclude_cn_from_sans` `(bool: false)` - If true, the given `common_name` will
  not be included in DNS or Email Subject Alternate Names (as appropriate).
  Useful if the CN is not a hostname or email address, but is instead some
  human-readable identifier.

- `permitted_dns_domains` `(string: "")` - A comma separated string (or, string
  array) containing DNS domains for which certificates are allowed to be issued
  or signed by this CA certificate. Note that subdomains are allowed, as per
  [RFC](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5280#section-4.2.1.10).

- `ou` `(string: "")` - Specifies the OU (OrganizationalUnit) values in the
  subject field of the resulting certificate. This is a comma-separated string
  or JSON array.

- `organization` `(string: "")` - Specifies the O (Organization) values in the
  subject field of the resulting certificate. This is a comma-separated string
  or JSON array.

- `country` `(string: "")` - Specifies the C (Country) values in the subject
  field of the resulting certificate. This is a comma-separated string or JSON
  array.

- `locality` `(string: "")` - Specifies the L (Locality) values in the subject
  field of the resulting certificate. This is a comma-separated string or JSON
  array.

- `province` `(string: "")` - Specifies the ST (Province) values in the subject
  field of the resulting certificate. This is a comma-separated string or JSON
  array.

- `street_address` `(string: "")` - Specifies the Street Address values in the
  subject field of the resulting certificate. This is a comma-separated string
  or JSON array.

- `postal_code` `(string: "")` - Specifies the Postal Code values in the
  subject field of the resulting certificate. This is a comma-separated string
  or JSON array.

- `serial_number` `(string: "")` -  - Specifies the default Subject's named
  [Serial Number](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4519#section-2.31)
  value, if any. If you want more than one, specify alternative names in the
  `alt_names` map using OID 2.5.4.5. Note that this has no impact on the
  Certificate's serial number field, which Vault randomly generates.

- `not_after` `(string)` - Set the Not After field of the certificate with
  specified date value. The value format should be given in UTC format
  `YYYY-MM-ddTHH:MM:SSZ`. Supports the Y10K end date for IEEE 802.1AR-2018
  standard devices, `9999-12-31T23:59:59Z`.

* ~> Note: Keys of type `rsa` currently only support PKCS#1 v1.5 signatures.

### Generate Intermediate CSR

This endpoint returns a new CSR for signing, optionally generating a new private
key. If using Vault as a root (and, like many other CAs), the various parameters
on the final signed certificate are set at signing time and _may or may not honor
the parameters set here_ (and transmitted in the returned CSR).

Note that this API supports [Managed Keys](/docs/enterprise/managed-keys);
additional details are available [below in a dedicated section](#managed-keys).

The parameters below are mostly meant as a helper function; not all possible
parameters that can be set in a CSR are supported in this request.

No new issuer is yet created by this call; note that a new key may be
generated depending on the `type` request parameter.

~> **Note**: In order to complete the intermediate generation, the CSR must be
   signed and the resulting certificate imported. This may involve working with
   external systems (such as an external or offline root CA) to transmit the
   CSR and complete the signing before the signed intermediate certificate is
   [imported](#import-ca-certificate-and-keys) into this mount.

| Method | Path                               | Private key source (`type`) |
| :----- | :--------------------------------- | :-------------------------- |
| `POST` | `/pki/intermediate/generate/:type` | specified per request       |
| `POST` | `/pki/generate/intermediate/:type` | specified per request       |
| `POST` | `/pki/intermediate/cross-sign`     | `existing`                  |

#### Parameters

- `type` `(string: <required>)` - Specifies the type of the intermediate to
  create. If `exported`, the private key will be returned in the response; if
  `internal` the private key will not be returned and _cannot be retrieved
  later_; if `existing`, we expect the `key_ref` parameter to use existing
  key material to create the CSR; `kms` is also supported: [see below for more
  details](#managed-keys). This parameter is part of the request URL.

- `common_name` `(string: <required>)` - Specifies the requested CN for the
  certificate. If more than one `common_name` is desired, specify the
  alternative names in the `alt_names` list.

- `alt_names` `(string: "")` - Specifies the requested Subject Alternative
  Names, in a comma-delimited list. These can be host names or email addresses;
  they will be parsed into their respective fields.

- `ip_sans` `(string: "")` - Specifies the requested IP Subject Alternative
  Names, in a comma-delimited list.

- `uri_sans` `(string: "")` - Specifies the requested URI Subject Alternative
  Names, in a comma-delimited list.

- `other_sans` `(string: "")` - Specifies custom OID/UTF8-string SANs. These
  must match values specified on the role in `allowed_other_sans` (see role
  creation for allowed_other_sans globbing rules).
  The format is the same as OpenSSL: `<oid>;<type>:<value>` where the
  only current valid type is `UTF8`. This can be a comma-delimited list or a
  JSON string slice.

- `format` `(string: "pem")` - Specifies the format for returned data. This can be
  `pem`, `der`, or `pem_bundle`; defaults to `pem`. If `der`, the output is
  base64 encoded. If `pem_bundle`, the `csr` field will contain the private key
  (if exported) and CSR, concatenated.

- `private_key_format` `(string: "der")` - Specifies the format for marshaling the
  private key. Defaults to `der` which will return either base64-encoded DER or
  PEM-encoded DER, depending on the value of `format`. The other option is
  `pkcs8` which will return the key marshalled as PEM-encoded PKCS8.

- `key_type` `(string: "rsa")` - Specifies the desired key type; must be `rsa`, `ed25519`
  or `ec`. Not suitable for `type=existing` requests.

~> **Note**: In FIPS 140-2 mode, the following algorithms are not certified
   and thus should not be used: `ed25519`.

~> **Note**: Keys of type `rsa` currently only support PKCS#1 v1.5 signatures.
   This includes any managed keys.

- `key_bits` `(int: 0)` - Specifies the number of bits to use for the
  generated keys. Allowed values are 0 (universal default); with
  `key_type=rsa`, allowed values are: 2048 (default), 3072, or
  4096; with `key_type=ec`, allowed values are: 224, 256 (default),
  384, or 521; ignored with `key_type=ed25519`. Not suitable for
  `type=existing` requests.

- `key_name` `(string: "")` - When a new key is created with this request,
  optionally specifies the name for this. The global ref `default` may not
  be used as a name.

- `key_ref` `(string: "default")` - Specifies the key (either `default`, by
  name, or by identifier) to use for generating this request. Only suitable
  for `type=existing` requests.

- `exclude_cn_from_sans` `(bool: false)` - If true, the given `common_name` will
  not be included in DNS or Email Subject Alternate Names (as appropriate).
  Useful if the CN is not a hostname or email address, but is instead some
  human-readable identifier.

  subject field of the resulting CSR. This is a comma-separated string
  or JSON array.

- `organization` `(string: "")` - Specifies the O (Organization) values in the
  subject field of the resulting CSR. This is a comma-separated string
  or JSON array.

- `country` `(string: "")` - Specifies the C (Country) values in the subject
  field of the resulting CSR. This is a comma-separated string or JSON
  array.

- `locality` `(string: "")` - Specifies the L (Locality) values in the subject
  field of the resulting CSR. This is a comma-separated string or JSON
  array.

- `province` `(string: "")` - Specifies the ST (Province) values in the subject
  field of the resulting CSR. This is a comma-separated string or JSON
  array.

  subject field of the resulting CSR. This is a comma-separated string
  or JSON array.

- `postal_code` `(string: "")` - Specifies the Postal Code values in the
  subject field of the resulting CSR. This is a comma-separated string
  or JSON array.

- `serial_number` `(string: "")` - Specifies the requested Subject's named
  [Serial Number](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4519#section-2.31)
  value, if any. If you want more than one, specify alternative names in the
  `alt_names` map using OID 2.5.4.5. Note that this has no impact on the
  Certificate's serial number field, which Vault randomly generates.

- `add_basic_constraints` `(bool: false)` - Whether to add a Basic Constraints
  extension with CA: true. Only needed as a workaround in some compatibility
  scenarios with Active Directory Certificate Services.

### Import CA Certificates and Keys

This endpoint allows submitting (importing) the CA information for the backend
via a PEM file containing the CA certificate and any private keys, concatenated
together, in any order.

Each certificate will be validated to ensure it is a valid CA (has an asserted
isCA basic constraint); non-CA certs will err. Any provided CRLs will be
ignored. Each unique certificate and private key will be imported as its own
issuer or key entry; duplicates (including with existing keys) will be ignored.

The response will indicate what issuers and keys were created as part of this
request (in the `imported_issuers` and `imported_keys`), along with a `mapping`
field, indicating which keys belong to which issuers (including from already
imported entries present in the same bundle).

| Method | Path                           | Allows private keys | Request Parameter |
| :----- | :----------------------------- | :------------------ | :---------------- |
| `POST` | `/pki/config/ca`               | yes                 | `pem_bundle`      |
| `POST` | `/pki/issuers/import/bundle`   | yes                 | `pem_bundle`      |
| `POST` | `/pki/issuers/import/cert`     | no                  | `pem_bundle`      |
| `POST` | `/pki/intermediate/set-signed` | no                  | `certificate`     |

~> **Note**: endpoints which allow importing private keys _should_ be considered
   highly privileged and restricted appropriately. Endpoints which allow
   importing issuers should also be restricted, but note that issuers without
   keys are unable to issue certificates or CRLs.

~> Note: Vault will deduplicate differently-encoded but same-valued keys and
   issuers. This means the returned certificate _may_ differ in encoding from
   the one provided on subsequent re-imports of the same issuer or key.

#### Parameters

- `pem_bundle` `(string: <required>)` - Specifies the unencrypted private key
  and certificate, concatenated in PEM format.

~> Note: this parameter is on the `/pki/config/ca` and `/pki/issuers/import/*`
   paths; it is not on the `/pki/intermediate/set-signed` path.

- `certificate` `(string: <required>)` - Specifies the certificates to import,
  concatenated in PEM format.

~> Note: this parameter is **only** on the `/pki/intermediate/set-signed` path.

#### Sample Request

```shell-session
$ curl \
    --header "X-Vault-Token: ..." \
    --request POST \
    --data "@payload.json" \
    http://127.0.0.1:8200/v1/pki/config/ca
```

Note that if you provide the data through the HTTP API, it must be
JSON-formatted, with newlines replaced with `\n`, like so:

```json
{
  "pem_bundle": "-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----\n...\n-----END CERTIFICATE-----"
}
```

#### Sample Response

```json
{
  "data": {
    "imported_issuers": ["1ae8ce9d-2f70-0761-a465-8c9840a247a2"],
    "imported_keys": ["97be2525-717a-e2f7-88da-0a20e11aad88"],
    "mapping": {
      "1ae8ce9d-2f70-0761-a465-8c9840a247a2": "97be2525-717a-e2f7-88da-0a20e11aad88"
    }
  }
}
```

### Read Issuer

This endpoint allows an operator to fetch a single issuer certificate and its
chain, including internal information not exposed on the [unauthenticated
`/pki/issuer/:issuer_ref/json`](#read-issuer-certificate) endpoint. This
includes information about the name, the key material, if an explicitly
constructed chain has been set, what the behavior is for signing longer TTL'd
certificates, and what usage modes are set on this issuer.

| Method | Path                      |
| :----- | :------------------------ |
| `GET`  | `/pki/issuer/:issuer_ref` |

#### Parameters

- `issuer_ref` `(string: <required>)` - Reference to an existing issuer,
  either by Vault-generated identifier, the literal string `default` to
  refer to the currently configured default issuer, or the name assigned
  to an issuer. This parameter is part of the request URL.

#### Sample Request

```shell-session
$ curl \
    --header "X-Vault-Token: ..." \
    http://127.0.0.1:8200/v1/pki/issuer/default
```

#### Sample Response

```text

  "data": {
    "ca_chain": [
      "-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----\nMIIDFDCCAfygAwIBAgIUXgxy54mKooz5soqQoRINazH/3pQwDQYJKoZIhvcNAQEL\n...",

    "leaf_not_after_behavior": "truncate",
    "manual_chain": null,
    "usage": "read-only,issuing-certificates,crl-signing"
  }
}
```

### Update Issuer

This endpoint allows an operator to manage a single issuer, updating various
properties about it, including its name, an explicitly constructed chain,
what the behavior is for signing longer TTL'd certificates, and what usage
modes are set on this issuer.

Note that it is not possible to change the certificate of this issuer; to
do so, import a new issuer and a new `issuer_id` will be assigned.

| Method | Path                      |
| :----- | :------------------------ |
| `POST` | `/pki/issuer/:issuer_ref` |

~> **Note** `POST`ing to this endpoint causes Vault to overwrite the previous
   contents of the issuer, using the provided request data (and any defaults
   for elided parameters). It does not update only the provided fields.

#### Parameters

- `issuer_ref` `(string: <required>)` - Reference to an existing issuer,
  either by Vault-generated identifier, the literal string `default` to
  refer to the currently configured default issuer, or the name assigned
  to an issuer. This parameter is part of the request URL.

- `issuer_name` `(string: "")` - Provides a name to the specified issuer. The
  name must be unique across all issuers and not be the reserved value
  `default`.

- `leaf_not_after_behavior` `(string: "err")` - Behavior of a leaf's
  `NotAfter` field during issuance. Valid options are:

  - `err`, to error if the computed `NotAfter` exceeds that of this issuer;
  - `truncate` to silently truncate the requested `NotAfter` value to that
    of this issuer; or
  - `permit` to allow this issuance to succeed with a `NotAfter` value
    exceeding that of this issuer.

~> Note: Not all values result in leaf certificates that can be validated
   through the entire validity period. It is suggested to use `truncate` for
   intermediate CAs and `permit` only for root CAs. This is because
   (root) certificates in browsers' trust stores typically aren't checked
   for validity, whereas intermediate CA certificates sent in TLS connections
   are checked for validity at the time of use. This means that a leaf
   certificate permitted to be issued for longer than the intermediate likely
   won't continue to validate after the intermediate has expired.

- `manual_chain` `([]string: nil)` - Chain of issuer references to build this
  issuer's computed CAChain field from, when non-empty.

~> Note: the `manual_chain` field is an advanced field useful when automatic
   chain building isn't desired. The first element _must_ be the present
   issuer's reference. Subsequent references _should_ validate previous
   entries, terminating with a root certificate. _Ideally_ a single linear
   chain would come first (from this issuer to a single root certificate)
   before any parallel, alternate chains appear.

- `usage` `([]string: read-only,issuing-certificates,crl-signing)` - Allowed
  usages for this issuer. Valid options are:

  - `read-only`, to allow this issuer to be read; implict; always allowed;
  - `issuing-certificates`, to allow this issuer to be used for issuing other
    certificates; or
  - `crl-signing`, to allow this issuer to be used for signing CRLs.

~> Note: The `usage` field allows for a soft-delete capability on the issuer,
   or to prevent use of the issuer prior to it being enabled. For example,
   as issuance is rotated to a new issuer, the old issuer could be marked
   `usage=read-only,crl-signing`, allowing existing certificates to be revoked
   (and the CRL updated), but preventing new certificate issuance. After all
   certificates issued under this certificate have expired, this certificate
   could be marked `usage=read-only`, freezing the CRL. Finally, after a grace
   period, the issuer could be deleted.

### Delete Issuer

This endpoint deletes the specified issuer. A warning is emitted and the
default is cleared if this issuer is the default issuer.

~> **Note**: If an issuer is incorrectly deleted, but its key material
   remains, it is possible to re-import just the issuer certificate. The
   `issuer_id` will change, but the name can be re-assigned to the new
   issuer.

| Method   | Path                      |
| :------- | :------------------------ |
| `DELETE` | `/pki/issuer/:issuer_ref` |

#### Sample Request

```shell-session
$ curl \
    --header "X-Vault-Token: ..." \
    --request DELETE \
    http://127.0.0.1:8200/v1/pki/issuer/root-x1
```

### Read Key

This endpoint allows an operator to fetch information about an existing key.

~> **Note**: Vault does not allow reading the value of the private key after
   it has been created.

| Method | Path                |
| :----- | :------------------ |
| `GET`  | `/pki/key/:key_ref` |

#### Parameters

- `key_ref` `(string: <required>)` - Reference to an existing key,
  either by Vault-generated identifier, the literal string `default` to
  refer to the currently configured default key, or the name assigned
  to a key. This parameter is part of the request URL.

#### Sample Request

```shell-session
$ curl \
    --header "X-Vault-Token: ..." \
    http://127.0.0.1:8200/v1/pki/key/default
```

#### Sample Response

```text
{
  "data": {
    "key_id": "8c4046f8-52a8-0974-29d2-745d8a0dd848",
    "key_name": "key-root-x1",
    "key_type": "rsa"
  }
}
```

### Update Key

This endpoint allows an operator to manage a single key. Currently, the only
parameter that is configurable is the key's name.

Note that it is not possible to change the private key of this key; to
do so, import a new key and a new `key_id` will be assigned.

| Method | Path                |
| :----- | :------------------ |
| `POST` | `/pki/key/:key_ref` |

~> **Note** `POST`ing to this endpoint causes Vault to overwrite the previous
   contents of the key, using the provided request data (and any defaults
   for elided parameters). It does not update only the provided fields.

#### Parameters

- `key_ref` `(string: <required>)` - Reference to an existing key,
  either by Vault-generated identifier, the literal string `default` to
  refer to the currently configured default key, or the name assigned
  to a key. This parameter is part of the request URL.

- `key_name` `(string: "")` - Provides a name to the specified key. The
  name must be unique across all keys and not be the reserved value
  `default`.

#### Sample Payload

```json
{
  "key_name": "key-root-x1"
}
```

#### Sample Request

```shell-session
$ curl \
    --header "X-Vault-Token: ..." \
    --request POST \
    --data @payload.json \
    http://127.0.0.1:8200/v1/pki/key/default
```

#### Sample Response

```text
{
  "data": {
    "key_id": "8c4046f8-52a8-0974-29d2-745d8a0dd848",
    "key_name": "key-root-x1",
    "key_type": "rsa"
  }
}
```

### Delete Key

This endpoint deletes the specified key. A warning is emitted and the
default is cleared if this key is the default key.

~> **Note**: Because Vault does not allow exporting the private key
   after it is initially generated, deletion of keys is a sensitive
   operation. Additionally, one key may be used by more than one issuer.
   As a result, Vault prohibits deletion of keys until **all** issuers
   using this key have also been deleted. If these issuers are still
   necessary for chain building, re-import them without the corresponding
   keys after the key has been deleted or use the soft-delete feature
   of issuers.

| Method   | Path                |
| :------- | :------------------ |
| `DELETE` | `/pki/key/:key_ref` |

#### Sample Request

```shell-session
$ curl \
    --header "X-Vault-Token: ..." \
    --request DELETE \
    http://127.0.0.1:8200/v1/pki/key/key-root-x1
```

### Delete All Issuers and Keys

This endpoint deletes all issuers and keys within the mount. It is highly
recommended to use the individual delete operations instead. This mount
will be unusable until new issuers and keys are provisioned.

_This endpoint requires sudo/root privileges._

| Method   | Path        |
| :------- | :---------- |
| `DELETE` | `/pki/root` |

#### Sample Request

```shell-session
$ curl \
    --header "X-Vault-Token: ..." \
    --request DELETE \
    http://127.0.0.1:8200/v1/pki/root
```

## Managing Authority Information

The following privileged endpoints allow the operator to control information
about the core contents of certificates and to perform privileged operations
like rotating the CRLs or performing tidy operations.

### List Roles

Refer to the [earlier section](#list-roles) for more information about
listing roles.

### Create/Update Role

This endpoint creates or updates the role definition. Note that the
`allowed_domains`, `allow_subdomains`, `allow_glob_domains`, and
`allow_any_name` attributes are additive; between them nearly and across
multiple roles nearly any issuing policy can be accommodated. `server_flag`,
`client_flag`, and `code_signing_flag` are additive as well. If a client
requests a certificate that is not allowed by the CN policy in the role, the
request is denied.

| Method | Path               |
| :----- | :----------------- |
| `POST` | `/pki/roles/:name` |

~> **Note** `POST`ing to this endpoint when the role already exists causes
   Vault to overwrite the contents of the role, using the provided request
   data (and any defaults for elided parameters). It does not update only
   the provided fields.

#### Parameters

- `name` `(string: <required>)` - Specifies the name of the role to create. This
  is part of the request URL.

- `issuer_ref`: `(string: "default")` - Specifies the default issuer of this
  request. May be the value `default`, a name, or an issuer ID. Use ACLs to
  prevent access to the `/pki/issuer/:issuer_ref/{issue,sign}/:name` paths
  to prevent users overriding the role's `issuer_ref` value.

~> Note: This parameter is stored as-is; if the reference is to a name, it
   is **not** resolve to an identifier. Deletion of issuers (or updating their
   names) **may** result in issuance failing or using an unexpected issuer.

~> **Note**: existing roles from previous Vault versions are migrated to use
   the `issuer_ref=default`.

- `ttl` `(string: "")` - Specifies the Time To Live value to be used for the
  validity period of the requested certificate, provided as a string duration
  with time suffix. Hour is the largest suffix. The value specified is strictly
  used for future validity. If not set, uses the system default value or the
  value of `max_ttl`, whichever is shorter. See `not_after` as an alternative
  for setting an absolute end date (rather than a relative one).

- `max_ttl` `(string: "")` - Specifies the maximum Time To Live provided as a
  string duration with time suffix. Hour is the largest suffix. If not set,
  defaults to the system maximum lease TTL.

- `allow_localhost` `(bool: true)` - Specifies if clients can request
  certificates for `localhost` as one of the requested common names. This is
  useful for testing and to allow clients on a single host to talk securely.

~> **Note**: This strictly applies to `localhost` and `localdomain` when this
   option is enabled. Additionally, even if this option is disabled, if either
   name is included in `allowed_domains`, the match rules for that option
   could permit issuance of a certificate for `localhost`.

- `allowed_domains` `(list: [])` - Specifies the domains this role is allowed
  to issue certificates for. This is used with the `allow_bare_domains`,
  `allow_subdomains`, and `allow_glob_domains` options to determine the type
  of matching between these domains and the values of common name, DNS-typed
  SAN entries, and Email-typed SAN entries. When `allow_any_name` is used,
  this attribute has no effect.

~> **Note**: The three options `allow_bare_domains`, `allow_subdomains`, and
   `allow_glob_domains` are each independent of each other. That is, at least
   one type of allowed matching must describe the relationship between the
   `allowed_domains` list and the names on the issued certificate. For example,
   given `allowed_domain=foo.*.example.com` and `allow_subdomains=true` and
   `allow_glob_domains=true`, a request for `bar.foo.baz.example.com` won't
   be permitted, even though it `foo.baz.example.com` matches the glob
   `foo.*.example.com` and `bar` is a subdomain of that.

- `allowed_domains_template` `(bool: false)` - When set, `allowed_domains`
  may contain templates, as with [ACL Path Templating](/docs/concepts/policies).
  Non-templated domains are also still permitted.

- `allow_bare_domains` `(bool: false)` - Specifies if clients can request
  certificates matching the value of the actual domains themselves; e.g. if a
  configured domain set with `allowed_domains` is `example.com`, this allows
  clients to actually request a certificate containing the name `example.com` as
  one of the DNS values on the final certificate. In some scenarios, this can be
  considered a security risk. Note that when an `allowed_domain` field contains
  a potential wildcard character (for example, `allowed_domains=*.example.com`)
  and `allow_bare_domains` and `allow_wildcard_certificates` are both enabled,
  issuance of a wildcard certificate for `*.example.com` will be permitted.

- `allow_subdomains` `(bool: false)` - Specifies if clients can request
  certificates with CNs that are subdomains of the CNs allowed by the other role
  options. _This includes wildcard subdomains._ For example, an
  `allowed_domains` value of `example.com` with this option set to true will
  allow `foo.example.com` and `bar.example.com` as well as `*.example.com`. To
  restrict issuance of wildcards by this option, see `allow_wildcard_certificates`
  below. This option is redundant when using the `allow_any_name` option.

- `allow_glob_domains` `(bool: false)` - Allows names specified in
  `allowed_domains` to contain glob patterns (e.g. `ftp*.example.com`). Clients
  will be allowed to request certificates with names matching the glob
  patterns.

~> **Note**: These globs behave like shell-style globs and can match
  across multiple domain parts. For example, `allowed_domains=*.example.com`
  with `allow_glob_domains` enabled will match not only `foo.example.com` but
  also `baz.bar.foo.example.com`.

~> **Warning**: Glob patterns will match wildcard domains and permit their
   issuance unless otherwise restricted by `allow_wildcard_certificates`. For
   instance, with `allowed_domains=*.*.example.com` and both `allow_glob_domains`
   and `allow_wildcard_certificates` enabled, we will permit the issuance of
   a wildcard certificate for `*.foo.example.com`.

- `allow_wildcard_certificates` `(bool: true)` - Allows the issuance of
  certificates with [RFC 6125](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6125) wildcards
  in the CN field. When set to `false`, this prevents wildcards from being
  issued even if they would've been allowed by an option above. We support
  the following four wildcard types:

  - `*.example.com`, a single wildcard as the entire left-most label,
  - `foo*.example.com`, a single suffixed wildcard in the left-most label,
  - `*foo.example.com`, a single prefixed wildcard in the left-most label, and
  - `f*o.example.com`, a single interior wildcard in the left-most label.

- `allow_any_name` `(bool: false)` - Specifies if clients can request any CN.
  Useful in some circumstances, but make sure you understand whether it is
  appropriate for your installation before enabling it. Note that both
  `enforce_hostnames` and `allow_wildcard_certificates` are still checked,
  which may introduce limitations on issuance with this option.

- `enforce_hostnames` `(bool: true)` - Specifies if only valid host names are
  allowed for CNs, DNS SANs, and the host part of email addresses.

- `allow_ip_sans` `(bool: true)` - Specifies if clients can request IP Subject
  Alternative Names. No authorization checking is performed except to verify
  that the given values are valid IP addresses.

- `allowed_uri_sans` `(string: "")` - Defines allowed URI Subject
  Alternative Names. No authorization checking is performed except to verify
  that the given values are valid URIs. This can be a comma-delimited list or
  a JSON string slice. Values can contain glob patterns (e.g.
  `spiffe://hostname/*`).

- `allowed_uri_sans_template` `()bool: false)` - When set, `allowed_uri_sans`
  may contain templates, as with [ACL Path Templating](/docs/concepts/policies).
  Non-templated domains are also still permitted.

- `allowed_other_sans` `(string: "")` - Defines allowed custom OID/UTF8-string
  SANs. This can be a comma-delimited list or a JSON string slice, where
  each element has the same format as OpenSSL: `<oid>;<type>:<value>`, but
  the only valid type is `UTF8` or `UTF-8`. The `value` part of an element
  may be a `*` to allow any value with that OID.
  Alternatively, specifying a single `*` will allow any `other_sans` input.

- `allowed_serial_numbers` `(string: "")` - If set, an array of allowed serial
  numbers to be requested during certificate issuance. These values support
  shell-style globbing. When empty, custom-specified serial numbers will be
  forbidden. It is strongly recommended to allow Vault to generate random
  serial numbers instead.

- `server_flag` `(bool: true)` - Specifies if certificates are flagged for
  server authentication use. See [RFC 5280 Section 4.2.1.12](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5280#section-4.2.1.12)
  for information about the Extended Key Usage field.

- `client_flag` `(bool: true)` - Specifies if certificates are flagged for
  client authentication use. See [RFC 5280 Section 4.2.1.12](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5280#section-4.2.1.12)
  for information about the Extended Key Usage field.

- `code_signing_flag` `(bool: false)` - Specifies if certificates are flagged
  for code signing use. See [RFC 5280 Section 4.2.1.12](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5280#section-4.2.1.12)
  for information about the Extended Key Usage field.

- `email_protection_flag` `(bool: false)` - Specifies if certificates are
  flagged for email protection use. See [RFC 5280 Section 4.2.1.12](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5280#section-4.2.1.12)
  for information about the Extended Key Usage field.

- `key_type` `(string: "rsa")` - Specifies the type of key to generate for
  generated private keys and the type of key expected for submitted CSRs.
  Currently, `rsa`, `ec`, and `ed25519` are supported, or when signing
  existing CSRs, `any` can be specified to allow keys of either type
  and with any bit size (subject to >1024 bits for RSA keys).

~> **Note**: In FIPS 140-2 mode, the following algorithms are not certified
   and thus should not be used: `ed25519`.

- `key_bits` `(int: 0)` - Specifies the number of bits to use for the
  generated keys. Allowed values are 0 (universal default); with
  `key_type=rsa`, allowed values are: 2048 (default), 3072, or
  4096; with `key_type=ec`, allowed values are: 224, 256 (default),
  384, or 521; ignored with `key_type=ed25519`.

- `signature_bits` `(int: 0)` - Specifies the number of bits to use in
  the signature algorithm; accepts 256 for SHA-2-256, 384 for SHA-2-384,
  and 512 for SHA-2-512. Defaults to 0 to automatically detect based
  on key length (SHA-2-256 for RSA keys, and matching the curve size
  for NIST P-Curves).

~> **Note**: ECDSA and Ed25519 issuers do not follow configuration of the
   `signature_bits` value; only RSA issuers will change signature types
   based on this parameter.

- `key_usage` `(list: ["DigitalSignature", "KeyAgreement", "KeyEncipherment"])` -
  Specifies the allowed key usage constraint on issued certificates. Valid
  values can be found at https://golang.org/pkg/crypto/x509/#KeyUsage - simply
  drop the `KeyUsage` part of the value. Values are not case-sensitive. To
  specify no key usage constraints, set this to an empty list. See
  [RFC 5280 Section 4.2.1.3](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5280#section-4.2.1.3)
  for more information about the Key Usage field.

- `ext_key_usage` `(list: [])` -
  Specifies the allowed extended key usage constraint on issued certificates. Valid
  values can be found at https://golang.org/pkg/crypto/x509/#ExtKeyUsage - simply
  drop the `ExtKeyUsage` part of the value. Values are not case-sensitive. To
  specify no key usage constraints, set this to an empty list. See
  [RFC 5280 Section 4.2.1.12](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5280#section-4.2.1.12)
  for information about the Extended Key Usage field.

- `ext_key_usage_oids` `(string: "")` - A comma-separated string or list of extended
  key usage oids. Useful for adding EKUs not supported by the Go standard library.

- `use_csr_common_name` `(bool: true)` - When used with the CSR signing
  endpoint, the common name in the CSR will be used instead of taken from the
  JSON data. This does not include any requested SANs in the CSR; use
  `use_csr_sans` for that.

- `use_csr_sans` `(bool: true)` - When used with the CSR signing endpoint, the
  subject alternate names in the CSR will be used instead of taken from the JSON
  data. This does not include the common name in the CSR; use
  `use_csr_common_name` for that.

- `ou` `(string: "")` - Specifies the OU (OrganizationalUnit) values in the
  subject field of issued certificates. This is a comma-separated string or
  JSON array.

- `organization` `(string: "")` - Specifies the O (Organization) values in the
  subject field of issued certificates. This is a comma-separated string or
  JSON array.

- `country` `(string: "")` - Specifies the C (Country) values in the
  subject field of issued certificates. This is a comma-separated string or
  JSON array.

- `locality` `(string: "")` - Specifies the L (Locality) values in the
  subject field of issued certificates. This is a comma-separated string or
  JSON array.

- `province` `(string: "")` - Specifies the ST (Province) values in the
  subject field of issued certificates. This is a comma-separated string or
  JSON array.

- `street_address` `(string: "")` - Specifies the Street Address values in the
  subject field of issued certificates. This is a comma-separated string or
  JSON array.

- `postal_code` `(string: "")` - Specifies the Postal Code values in the
  subject field of issued certificates. This is a comma-separated string or
  JSON array.

- `generate_lease` `(bool: false)` - Specifies if certificates issued/signed
  against this role will have Vault leases attached to them. Certificates can be
  added to the CRL by `vault revoke <lease_id>` when certificates are associated
  with leases. It can also be done using the `pki/revoke` endpoint. However,
  when lease generation is disabled, invoking `pki/revoke` would be the only way
  to add the certificates to the CRL. When large number of certificates are
  generated with long lifetimes, it is recommended that lease generation be
  disabled, as large amount of leases adversely affect the startup time of Vault.

- `no_store` `(bool: false)` - If set, certificates issued/signed against this
  role will not be stored in the storage backend. This can improve performance
  when issuing large numbers of certificates. However, certificates issued in
  this way cannot be enumerated or revoked, so this option is recommended only
  for certificates that are non-sensitive, or extremely short-lived. This
  option implies a value of `false` for `generate_lease`.

- `require_cn` `(bool: true)` - If set to false, makes the `common_name` field
  optional while generating a certificate.

- `policy_identifiers` `(list: [])` - A comma-separated string or list of policy
  OIDs.

- `basic_constraints_valid_for_non_ca` `(bool: false)` - Mark Basic Constraints
  valid when issuing non-CA certificates.

- `not_before_duration` `(duration: "30s")` - Specifies the duration by which to
  backdate the NotBefore property. This value has no impact in the validity period
  of the requested certificate, specified in the `ttl` field.

- `not_after` `(string)` - Set the Not After field of the certificate with
  specified date value. The value format should be given in UTC format
  `YYYY-MM-ddTHH:MM:SSZ`. Supports the Y10K end date for IEEE 802.1AR-2018
  standard devices, `9999-12-31T23:59:59Z`.

This endpoint fetches the URLs to be encoded in generated certificates. No URL
configuration will be returned until the configuration is set.

| Method | Path               |
| :----- | :----------------- |
| `GET`  | `/pki/config/urls` |

#### Sample Request

```shell-session
$ curl \
    --header "X-Vault-Token: ..." \
    http://127.0.0.1:8200/v1/pki/config/urls
```

{
  "lease_id": "",
  "renewable": false,
  "lease_duration": 0,
  "data": {
    "issuing_certificates": ["<url1>", "<url2>"],
    "crl_distribution_points": ["<url1>", "<url2>"],
    "ocsp_servers": ["<url1>", "<url2>"]
  },
  "auth": null
}
```

### Set URLs

This endpoint allows setting the issuing certificate endpoints, CRL distribution
points, and OCSP server endpoints that will be encoded into issued certificates.
You can update any of the values at any time without affecting the other
existing values. To remove the values, simply use a blank string as the
parameter.

| Method | Path               |
| :----- | :----------------- |
| `POST` | `/pki/config/urls` |

#### Parameters

- `issuing_certificates` `(array<string>: nil)` - Specifies the URL values for
  the Issuing Certificate field. This can be an array or a comma-separated
  string list. See also [RFC 5280 Section 4.2.2.1](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5280#section-4.2.2.1)
  for information about the Authority Information Access field.

- `crl_distribution_points` `(array<string>: nil)` - Specifies the URL values
  for the CRL Distribution Points field. This can be an array or a
  comma-separated string list. See also [RFC 5280 Section 4.2.1.13](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5280#section-4.2.1.13)
  for information about the CRL Distribution Points field.

~> Note: When multiple Performance Replication clusters are enabled, each
   cluster will have its own CRL. Additionally, when multiple issuers are
   in use under a single mount, each issuer will also have its own CRL
   distribution point. These separate CRLs should either be aggregated into a
   single CRL (externally; as Vault does not support this functionality)
   or multiple `crl_distribution_points` should be specified here, pointing
   to each cluster and issuer.

- `ocsp_servers` `(array<string>: nil)` - Specifies the URL values for the OCSP
  Servers field. This can be an array or a comma-separated string list. See also
  [RFC 5280 Section 4.2.2.1](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5280#section-4.2.2.1)
  for information about the Authority Information Access field.

#### Sample Payload

```json
{
  "ocsp_servers": ["https://..."]
}
```

#### Sample Request

```shell-session
$ curl \
    --header "X-Vault-Token: ..." \
    --request POST \
    --data @payload.json \
    http://127.0.0.1:8200/v1/pki/config/urls
```

{
  "default": "baadd98d-ec5a-66ac-06b7-dfc91c02c9cf"
}
```

#### Sample Request

```shell-session
$ curl \
    --header "X-Vault-Token: ..." \
    --request POST \
    --data @payload.json \
    http://127.0.0.1:8200/v1/pki/config/keys

  "data": {
    "default": "baadd98d-ec5a-66ac-06b7-dfc91c02c9cf"
  }
}
```

### Read CRL Configuration

This endpoint allows getting the duration for which the generated CRL should be
marked valid. No CRL configuration will be returned until the configuration is
set, but the CRL will still default to enabled with 72h expiration.

| Method | Path              |
| :----- | :---------------- |
| `GET`  | `/pki/config/crl` |

#### Sample Request

```shell-session
$ curl \
    --header "X-Vault-Token: ..." \
    http://127.0.0.1:8200/v1/pki/config/crl
```

#### Sample Response

```json
{
  "lease_id": "",
  "renewable": false,
  "lease_duration": 0,
  "data": {
    "disable": false,
    "expiry": "72h"
  },
  "auth": null
}
```

### Set CRL Configuration

This endpoint allows setting the duration for which the generated CRL should be
marked valid. If the CRL is disabled, it will return a signed but zero-length
CRL for any request. If enabled, it will re-build the CRL.

~> **Note**: This parameter is global, across all clusters and issuers. Use
   the per-issuer `usage` field to disable CRL building for a specific
   issuer, while leaving the global CRL building enabled.

~> Note: Disabling the CRL does not affect whether revoked certificates are
stored internally. Certificates that have been revoked when a role's
certificate storage is enabled will continue to be marked and stored as
revoked until `tidy` has been run with the desired safety buffer. Re-enabling
CRL generation will then result in all such certificates becoming a part of
the CRL.

| Method | Path              |
| :----- | :---------------- |
| `POST` | `/pki/config/crl` |

#### Parameters

- `expiry` `(string: "72h")` - The amount of time the generated CRL should be valid.
- `disable` `(bool: false)` - Disables or enables CRL building.

#### Sample Payload

```json
{
  "expiry": "48h"
}
```

#### Sample Request

```shell-session
$ curl \
    --header "X-Vault-Token: ..." \
    --request POST \
    --data @payload.json \
    http://127.0.0.1:8200/v1/pki/config/crl
```

### Rotate CRLs

This endpoint forces a rotation of all issuers' CRLs. This can be used by
administrators to cut the size of the CRL if it contains a number of
certificates that have now expired, but has not been rotated due to no further
certificates being revoked. If no certificates have been revoked, but the CRL
has expired or is close to expiring, administrators **must** hit this endpoint
to manually rotate the CRL. This rotates all CRLs on the present cluster,
and **must** be called on every cluster.

~> **Note**: Mirroring the behavior of earlier Vault versions, we add
   certificates revoked by an unknown issuer to the default issuer's CRL.
   To fully purge old revoked, unexpired certificates, it is not sufficient
   to delete their issuer and is instead necessary to **remove** the mount
   completely.

| Method | Path              |
| :----- | :---------------- |
| `GET`  | `/pki/crl/rotate` |

#### Sample Request

```shell-session
$ curl \
    --header "X-Vault-Token: ..." \
    http://127.0.0.1:8200/v1/pki/crl/rotate
```

#### Sample Response

```json
{
  "data": {
    "success": true
  }
}
```

### Tidy

This endpoint allows tidying up the storage backend and/or CRL by removing
certificates that have expired and are past a certain buffer period beyond their
expiration time.

| Method | Path        |
| :----- | :---------- |
| `POST` | `/pki/tidy` |

#### Parameters

- `tidy_cert_store` `(bool: false)` Specifies whether to tidy up the certificate
  store.

- `tidy_revoked_certs` `(bool: false)` Set to true to remove all invalid and
  expired certificates from storage. A revoked storage entry is considered
  invalid if the entry is empty, or the value within the entry is empty. If a
  certificate is removed due to expiry, the entry will also be removed from the
  CRL, and the CRL will be rotated.

- `safety_buffer` `(string: "")` Specifies A duration (given as an integer
  number of seconds or a string; defaults to `72h`) used as a safety buffer to
  ensure certificates are not expunged prematurely; as an example, this can keep
  certificates from being removed from the CRL that, due to clock skew, might
  still be considered valid on other hosts. For a certificate to be expunged,
  the time must be after the expiration time of the certificate (according to
  the local clock) plus the duration of `safety_buffer`.

#### Sample Payload

```json
{
  "safety_buffer": "24h"
}
```

#### Sample Request

```shell-session
$ curl \
    --header "X-Vault-Token: ..." \
    --request POST \
    --data @payload.json \
    http://127.0.0.1:8200/v1/pki/tidy
```

### Tidy Status

This is a read only endpoint that returns information about the current tidy
operation, or the most recent if none are currently running.

The result includes the following fields:
* `safety_buffer`: the value of this parameter when initiating the tidy operation
* `tidy_cert_store`: the value of this parameter when initiating the tidy operation
* `tidy_revoked_certs`: the value of this parameter when initiating the tidy operation
* `state`: one of *Inactive*, *Running*, *Finished*, *Error*
* `error`: the error message, if the operation ran into an error
* `time_started`: the time the operation started
* `time_finished`: the time the operation finished
* `message`: One of *Tidying certificate store: checking entry N of TOTAL* or
  *Tidying revoked certificates: checking certificate N of TOTAL*
* `cert_store_deleted_count`: The number of certificate storage entries deleted
* `revoked_cert_deleted_count`: The number of revoked certificate entries deleted

| Method | Path               |
| :----- | :----------------- |
| `GET`  | `/pki/tidy-status` |

#### Sample Request

$ curl \
    --header "X-Vault-Token: ..." \
    --request GET \
    http://127.0.0.1:8200/v1/pki/tidy-status

```

#### Sample Response

    "error": null,
    "message": "Tidying certificate store: checking entry 234 of 488",
    "revoked_cert_deleted_count": 0,
    "cert_store_deleted_count": 2,
    "state": "Running",
    "time_started": "2021-10-20T14:52:13.510161-04:00",
    "time_finished": null
  },

## Cluster Scalability

Most non-introspection operations in the PKI secrets engine require a write to
storage, and so are forwarded to the cluster's active node for execution.
This table outlines which operations can be executed on performance standbys
and thus scale horizontally.

| Path                        | Operations           |
| --------------------------- | -------------------- |
| ca[/pem]                    | Read                 |
| cert/<em>serial-number</em> | Read                 |
| cert/ca_chain               | Read                 |
| config/crl                  | Read                 |
| certs                       | List                 |
| ca_chain                    | Read                 |
| crl[/pem]                   | Read                 |
| crl/pem                     | Read                 |
| issue                       | Update <sup>\*</sup> |
| revoked/\*                  | Read, List           |
| sign                        | Update <sup>\*</sup> |
| sign-verbatim               | Update <sup>\*</sup> |

\* Only if the corresponding role has `no_store` set to true and `generate_lease`
set to false. If `generate_lease` is true the lease creation will be forwarded to
the active node; if `no_store` is false the entire request will be forwarded to
the active node.

## Managed Keys

~> Note: Managed keys are an Enterprise only feature.

The [Generate Root](#generate-root) and [Generate Intermediate](#generate-intermediate)
API calls can leverage the Managed Keys feature, delegating operations that
require private key material to an external system.

To leverage a Managed Key, assuming it has already been configured, set the type
parameter to `kms` within either, [Generate Root](#generate-root) or
[Generate Intermediate](#generate-intermediate) APIs, and one of either
`managed_key_name` or `managed_key_id` parameters specifying a Managed Key to use.
As with the `internal` type for those APIs, if the type parameter is set to `kms`,
there is no way to read/fetch the private key.

The API call will fail if the specified Managed Key is not properly configured or
arguments detailing private key attributes are specified such as `key_type` or
`key_bits`.

Once either of the certificate APIs have successfully executed, all other PKI
operations behave the same, with no other special configuration or parameters required.


## Vault CLI with DER/PEM responses

The Vault CLI can only display JSON responses. For APIs that return non-JSON formatted
data such as DER and PEM formats, `vault read` will fail and another client such as curl
must be used.
