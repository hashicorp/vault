# GCP Cloud KMS (API)

The Key Management secrets engine supports lifecycle management of keys in [GCP Cloud KMS](https://cloud.google.com/security-key-management)
[key rings](https://cloud.google.com/kms/docs/resource-hierarchy#key_rings). This is accomplished by
configuring a KMS provider resource with the `gcpckms` provider and other provider-specific parameter
values.

The following sections provide API documentation that is specific to GCP Cloud KMS.

## Create/Update KMS Provider

This endpoint creates or updates a KMS provider. If a KMS provider with the given `name`
does not exist, it will be created. If the KMS provider exists, it will be updated with
the given parameter values.

| Method | Path                 |
| :----- | :------------------- |
| `POST` | `/keymgmt/kms/:name` |

### Parameters

- `name` `(string: <required>)` – Specifies the name of the KMS provider to create or update.
  This is provided as part of the request URL.

- `provider` `(string: <required>)` – Specifies the name of a KMS provider that's external to
  Vault. Must be set to `gcpckms`. Cannot be changed after creation.

- `key_collection` `(string: <required>)` – Refers to the
  [resource ID](https://cloud.google.com/kms/docs/resource-hierarchy#retrieve_resource_id)
  of an existing GCP Cloud KMS [key ring](https://cloud.google.com/kms/docs/resource-hierarchy#key_rings).
  Cannot be changed after creation.

- `credentials` `(map<string|string>: nil)` – The credentials to use for authentication with GCP
  Cloud KMS. Supplying values for this parameter is optional, as credentials may also be specified
  as environment variables. See the [authentication](/vault/docs/secrets/key-management/gcpkms#authentication)
  section for details on precedence.

  - `service_account_file` `(string: <required>)` - The path to a Google service account key file. The
    key file must be readable on the host that Vault server is running on. May also be provided by the
    `GOOGLE_CREDENTIALS` environment variable or by
    [application default credentials](https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/production).
