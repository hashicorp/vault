# Azure key Vault (API)

The Key Management secrets engine supports lifecycle management of keys in named
[Azure Key Vault](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/key-vault/) instances.
This is accomplished by configuring a KMS provider resource with the `azurekeyvault`
provider and other provider-specific parameter values.

The following sections provide API documentation that is specific to Azure Key Vault.

## Create/Update KMS provider

This endpoint creates or updates a KMS provider. If a KMS provider with the given `name`
does not exist, it will be created. If the KMS provider exists, it will be updated with
the given parameter values.

| Method | Path                 |

| `POST` | `/keymgmt/kms/:name` |
