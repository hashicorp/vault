# `/identity/mfa`

## Supported MFA types.

- [TOTP](/vault/api-docs/secret/identity/mfa/totp)

- [Okta](/vault/api-docs/secret/identity/mfa/okta)

- [Duo](/vault/api-docs/secret/identity/mfa/duo)

- [PingID](/vault/api-docs/secret/identity/mfa/pingid)

## Other

- [Login Enforcement](/vault/api-docs/secret/identity/mfa/login-enforcement)
- [MFA Validate](/vault/api-docs/system/mfa/validate)

While the above endpoints are available in both the open source and Enterprise versions of Vault,
they are namespace aware. MFA methods and login enforcements created in one namespace are separate from other
namespaces. In the open source version of Vault, everything operates in the root namespace.
