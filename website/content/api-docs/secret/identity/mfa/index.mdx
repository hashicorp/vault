# `/identity/mfa`

## Supported MFA types.

- [TOTP](/vault/api-docs/secret/identity/mfa/totp)

- [Okta](/vault/api-docs/secret/identity/mfa/okta)

- [Duo](/vault/api-docs/secret/identity/mfa/duo)

- [PingID](/vault/api-docs/secret/identity/mfa/pingid)

## Other

- [Login Enforcement](/vault/api-docs/secret/identity/mfa/login-enforcement)
- [MFA Validate](/vault/api-docs/system/mfa/validate)

While the above endpoints are available in all editions of Vault,
they are namespace aware. MFA methods and login enforcements created in one namespace are separate from other
namespaces. In the community version of Vault, everything operates in the root namespace.
