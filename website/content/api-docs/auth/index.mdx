# Auth methods

Each auth method publishes its own set of API paths and methods. These endpoints
are documented in this section. Auth methods are enabled at a path, but the
documentation will assume the default paths for simplicity. If you are enabling
at a different path, you should adjust your API calls accordingly.

For the API documentation for a specific auth method, please choose a auth
method from the navigation.
