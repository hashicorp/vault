# `/sys/capabilities-self`

The `/sys/capabilities-self` endpoint is used to fetch the capabilities of the
token used to make the API call, on the given paths. The capabilities returned
will be derived from the policies that are on the token, and from the policies
to which the token is entitled to through the entity and entity's group
memberships.

## Query self capabilities

This endpoint returns the capabilities of client token on the given paths. The
client token is the Vault token with which this API call is made. Multiple
paths are taken in at once and the capabilities of the token for each path is
returned. For backwards compatibility, if a single path is supplied, a
`capabilities` field will also be returned.
