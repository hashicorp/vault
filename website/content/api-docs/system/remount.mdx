  The '/sys/remount' endpoint is used remount a mounted backend to a new
  endpoint.

# Remount ( API )

The Remount documentation details the endpoints required to trigger and monitor the status of a remount operation.

## Move backend

@include 'alerts/restricted-admin.mdx'

The `/sys/remount` endpoint moves an already-mounted backend to a new mount point. Remounting works for both secret
engines and auth methods.

Vault returns a migration ID when the remount operation completes. You
can use the migration ID to look up the status of the mount migration.
More details about the remount operation are described in
[Mount Migration](/vault/docs/concepts/mount-migration).

~> Note: This endpoint requires a policy with both `sudo` and `update` capabilities to `sys/remount`

~> Note: A mount migration will revoke all leases for the secrets of a secrets backend or tokens of an auth backend,
depending on which type of backend is being moved.

## Monitor migration status

@include 'alerts/restricted-admin.mdx'

This endpoint is used to monitor the status of a mount migration operation, using the ID returned in the response
of the `sys/remount` call. The response contains the passed-in ID, the source and target mounts, and a status field
that displays `in-progress`, `success` or `failure`.

- `migration_id` `(string: <required>)` – Specifies the id of the mount migration

### Sample request

### Sample response

```json
{
  "migration_id": "ef3ba21c-8be8-4e5f-8d00-cb46a532c665",
