# `/sys/managed-keys`

@include 'alerts/restricted-root.mdx'

The `/sys/managed-keys` endpoint is used to manage the Managed Key configuration within Vault.
See the [Managed Keys](/vault/docs/enterprise/managed-keys) section for further details on the Managed Keys system.

## List managed keys.

This endpoint lists all the Managed Keys of a certain type within the namespace.

| Method | Path                      |
|:-------|:--------------------------|
| `LIST` | `/sys/managed-keys/:type` |

### Parameters
- `type` `(string: <required>)` – The backend type of keys to be listed.
Supported options are `pkcs11`, `awskms` and `azurekeyvault`.

### Sample request

```shell-session
$ curl \
    --request LIST \
    --header "X-Vault-Token: ..." \
    http://127.0.0.1:8200/v1/sys/managed-keys/pkcs11
```

### Sample response

```json
{
  "keys": [
    "hsm-key1",
    "hsm-key2"
  ]
}
```

## Create/Update managed key

An endpoint that will create or update a Managed Key within a given namespace. The :type refers to the backend type
that the key is to use, such as `pkcs11`. The :name argument is unique name within all managed key types in
the namespace.

| Method | Path                            |
|:-------|:--------------------------------|
| `POST` | `/sys/managed-keys/:type/:name` |

### Sample payload

```json
{
  "library": "softhsm",
  "slot": "693149389",
  "pin": "12345",
  "key_label": "hsm-key1",
  "mechanism": "0x0001"
}
```

### Sample request

```shell-session
$ curl \
    --request POST \
    --header "X-Vault-Token: ..." \
    --data @payload.json \
    http://127.0.0.1:8200/v1/sys/managed-keys/pkcs11/hsm-key1
```

### Generic parameters
- `name` `(string: <required>)` - A unique lowercase name that serves as identifying the key. Must be
  unique throughout all types in the namespace.

- `type` `(string: <required>)` – The backend type that will be leveraged for the managed key.
  Supported options are `pkcs11`, `awskms` and `azurekeyvault`.

- `allow_generate_key` `(string: "false")` - If no existing key can be found in the referenced backend, instructs
  Vault to generate a key within the backend.

  ~> **NOTE**: Once the initial key creation has occurred, it is advisable to disable this flag to prevent any
  unintended key creation in the future.

- `allow_replace_key` `(string: "false")` - Controls the ability for Vault to replace through generation or importing
  a key into the configured backend even if a key is present, if set to false those operations are forbidden
  if a key exists.

- `allow_store_key` `(string: "false")` - Controls the ability for Vault to export a Vault private key
  to the configured HSM, if "false" those operations will be forbidden.

- `any_mount` `(string: "false")` - Allow usage from any mount point within the namespace if "true". If "false"
  specific mount points will need their `allowed_managed_keys` parameter to be updated with the key name to
  grant usage.

- `usages` `(comma-delimited string: "sign,verify")` - A comma-delimited list of the allowed usages of this key. Valid values
  are encrypt, decrypt, sign, verify, wrap, unwrap, mac, and random.

#### PKCS#11 backend parameters

<Note>
  The <code>pkcs11</code> backend is only available with Vault Enterprise plus HSMs
</Note>

- `type` `(string: "pkcs11")` - To select a PKCS#11 backend, the type parameter must be set to `pkcs11`.

- `library` `(string: <required>)` - The name of the `kms_library` stanza to use from Vault's config to
   lookup the local library path. See [kms_library stanza](/vault/docs/configuration/kms-library) for further details.

- `key_label` `(string: <required>)` - The label of the key to use. If the key does not exist
  and generation is enabled, this is the label that will be given to the generated key. This
  value or `key_id` must be specified.

- `key_id` `(string: <required>)` - The id of a PKCS#11 key to use. As key ids are created by
  the HSM, it is an error if the key does not yet exist. This value or `key_label` must be
  specified.

- `mechanism` `(string: <required>)` - The encryption/decryption mechanism to use,
  specified as a hexadecimal (prefixed by 0x) string. The following are supported mechanisms
    - `0x1041` `CKM_ECDSA`
    - `0x000D` `CKM_RSA_PKCS_PSS`
    - `0x0009` `CKM_RSA_PKCS_OAEP`
    - `0x0001` `CKM_RSA_PKCS`

  ~> **Note**: It is possible to use unsupported mechanisms with a managed key, however automatic key generation is only
  possible with the above supported mechanisms. Automatic key generation is also currently a best effort operation and may
  not function correctly on all HSMs.

- `pin` `(string: <required>)`: The PIN for login.

- `slot` `(string: <slot or token label required>)`: The slot number to use,
  specified as a string in a decimal format (e.g. `"2305843009213693953"`).

  ~> **Note**: Slots are typically listed as hex-decimal values in the OS setup
  utility but this configuration uses their decimal equivalent. For example, using the
  HSM command-line `pkcs11-tool`, a slot listed as `0x2000000000000001`in hex is equal
  to `2305843009213693953` in decimal; these values may be listed shorter or
  differently as determined by the HSM in use.

- `token_label` `(string: <slot or token label required>)`: The slot token label to
  use.

- `curve` `(string: "" <required if allow_generate_key is true>)` - supplies the curve value when using the `CKM_ECDSA mechanism`.
  The supported values are
    - `P384`
    - `P521`
    - `P256`

- `key_bits` `(int: 0 <required if allow_generate_key is true>)` - supplies the size in bits of the key when using `CKM_RSA_PKCS_PSS`,
  `CKM_RSA_PKCS_OAEP` or `CKM_RSA_PKCS` as a value for `mechanism`.
  The supported values are
    - 2048
    - 3072
    - 4096

- `force_rw_session` `(string: "false")` - Force all operations to open up
  a read-write session to the HSM. This is a boolean expressed as a string (e.g.
  `"true"`). This key is mainly to work around a limitation within AWS's CloudHSM v5
  pkcs11 implementation.

- `max_parallel` `(int: 1)` - The number of concurrent requests that may be in
  flight to the HSM at any given time.

#### AWS KMS parameters
- `type` `(string: "awskms")` - To select an AWS KMS backend, the type parameter must be set to `awskms`.

- `access_key` `(string: <required>)`: The AWS access key to use. This may also be provided in
  the `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` environment variable or as part of the AWS profile from the AWS CLI or
  instance profile.

- `curve` `(string: "" <required if allow_generate_key is true>)`: The curve to use for an ECDSA key.
  This field is used when `key_type` is `ECDSA`. Supported options are `P256`, `P384`, or `P521`.

- `endpoint` `(string: "")`: Used to specify a custom AWS endpoint. If not set, Vault will use
  the default API endpoint for your region.

- `key_bits` `(string: <required>)`: The size in bits for an RSA key. This field is required when
  `key_type` is `RSA`. Supported values are `2048`, `3072`, and `4096`.

- `key_type` `(string: <required>)`: The type of key to use. Supported values are `RSA` and
  `ECDSA` (not case sensitive). If the key type is `RSA`, the `key_bits` field is also required.
  If the key type is `ECDSA`, the `curve` field is required.

- `kms_key` `(string: <required>)`: An identifier for the key. If `allow_generate_key` is set to
  `false`, the value can be either an ARN, an AWS alias, or the key ID generated by AWS KMS. If
  `allow_generate_key` is set to `true`, the value must be an AWS alias. If a key with the provided
  alias does not already exist, Vault will generate a key and create an alias for it using this parameter.

  ~> **Note**: when creating a key through AWS KMS to be used with managed keys, note
  that the key usage must be `SIGN_VERIFY`. When using an elliptic curve key, the
  combination `key_type=ECDSA` and `curve=P256` corresponds to the AWS Key Spec
  `ECC_NIST_P256`.

- `region` `(string: "us-east-1")`: The AWS region where the keys are stored (or will be stored).
  This may also be provided in the `AWS_REGION` or `AWS_DEFAULT_REGION` environment variables,
  from your `~/.aws/config` file, or from instance metadata.

- `secret_key` `(string: <required>)`: The AWS secret key ID to use. This may also be provided in
  the `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` environment variable or as part of the AWS profile from the AWS CLI
  or instance profile.

#### Azure key Vault parameters
- `type` `(string: "azurekeyvault")` - To select an Azure Key Vault backend, the type parameter must be set to `azurekeyvault`.

- `resource` `(string: "vault.azure.net")`: The Azure Key Vault resource's DNS Suffix to connect
  to. Needs to be changed to connect to Azure's Managed HSM KeyVault instance type.

- `key_bits` `(string: <required if allow_generate_key is true>)`: The size in bits for an RSA key.
   This field is required when `key_type` is `RSA`. Supported values are `2048`, `3072`, and `4096`.
