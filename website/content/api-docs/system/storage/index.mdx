  The '/sys/storage' endpoints are used to manage Vault's storage backends.
---

This API sub-section is currently only used to manage [Raft](/vault/api-docs/system/storage/raft) storage backend.

On Enterprise there are additional endpoints for working with [Raft Automated Snapshots](/vault/api-docs/system/storage/raftautosnapshots).
