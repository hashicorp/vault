# `/sys/storage`

@include 'alerts/restricted-root.mdx'

This API sub-section is currently only used to manage [Raft](/vault/api-docs/system/storage/raft) storage backend.

On Enterprise there are additional endpoints for working with [Raft Automated Snapshots](/vault/api-docs/system/storage/raftautosnapshots).
