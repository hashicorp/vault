@include 'alerts/enterprise-only.mdx'

The `/sys/storage/raft/snapshot-load` endpoints are used to manage loaded
snapshots within the Vault cluster.

## Load a snapshot into Vault


| Method | Path                                           |
| :----- | :--------------------------------------------- |
| `POST` | `/sys/storage/raft/snapshot-load` |

Load a new snapshot into the Vault cluster, without restoring the cluster to the
snapshot's state. Recover, read, and list individual pieces of data from the
loaded snapshot.

A Vault cluster can only have 1 snapshot loaded at a time. A loaded snapshot will
be automatically unloaded 72 hours after it is loaded.

### Sample request

    --data-binary @raft.snap \
