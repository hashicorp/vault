# `/sys/config/group-policy-application`

@include 'alerts/enterprise-only.mdx'

<Warning>
  The group policy application mode only applies to ACL policies and no longer
  affects Vault sentinel role governing policies (RGPs) for the following Vault
  versions:

  - `1.15.0+`
  - `1.14.4+`
  - `1.13.8+`

</Warning>

The `sys/config/group-policy-application` endpoint can be used to configure the
mode of policy application for identity groups in Vault. This setting dictates
the behavior across all groups in all namespaces in Vault.

Vault allows you to add entities and groups from any namespace into an identity group.
However, historically, any policies attached to that group would only apply when the
Vault token authorizing a request was created in the same namespace as that group,
or a descendent namespace. This endpoint allows relaxing that restriction: when the mode is set to the default,
`within_namespace_hierarchy`, the historical behaviour is maintained,
but when set to `any`, group policies apply to all members of a group,
regardless of what namespace the request token came from.

Note that this configuration will be replicated between primary and secondaries, that
is to say, primaries cannot have a different policy application mode to secondaries.

## Get group policy application information

This endpoint returns the current group policy application mode, which will be
either `within_namespace_hierarchy` or `any`.


| Method | Path                          |
| :----- | :---------------------------- |
| `GET`  | `/sys/config/group-policy-application` |

### Sample request

```shell-session
$ curl \
  --header "X-Vault-Token: ..." \
    'http://127.0.0.1:8200/v1/sys/config/group-policy-application'
```

### Sample response

```json
{
   "group_policy_application_mode": "within_namespace_hierarchy"
}
```

## Set group policy application information

This endpoint allows you to modify the current group policy application mode, which can be
either `within_namespace_hierarchy` or `any`. `within_namespace_hierarchy`
restricts policy application to only policies from groups from parent namespaces, and
`any` does not restrict policy application in any way, and policies will apply from any namespace,
irrespective of namespace hierarchy.
