# `/sys/activation-flags`

@include 'alerts/restricted-root.mdx'

The `/sys/activation-flags` endpoints are used to read and manage certain features that are gated by a 
one-time flag before use. Before being activated, endpoints to the given feature will be blocked and an
error response will be returned. Upon activation, the filter on the feature's paths will be removed. As
these flags are one-time operations, there is no way to unactivate a feature once activated.

## Read activation flags

This endpoint is used to return the current state of Vault's activation flags. The response contains
two lists of feature names. The first list `activated` contains the names of features that have
already been activated. The second list `unactivated` contains all remaining features that are available
but have not yet been activated.

Reading this endpoint does not require authentication.

| Method | Path                    |

| `GET`  | `/sys/activation-flags` |

### Sample request

```shell-session
$ curl \
    --request GET \

## Write activation flags

This endpoint is used to activate a given feature, unblocking its endpoints and letting the feature
begin to function. The feature name is placed within the path of the API call.

| Method | Path                                      |
| :----- | :---------------------------------------- |
| `PUT`  | `/sys/activation-flags/:feature/activate` |

### Parameters

- `feature` `(string: <required>)` – Specifies the name of the Vault feature that is currently
unactivated. Must be provided as part of the API path and cannot be specified in a payload.

```shell-session
$ curl \
    --request PUT \
    --header "X-Vault-Token: $VAULT_TOKEN" \
    http://127.0.0.1:8200/v1/sys/activation-flags/secrets-sync/activate
```
