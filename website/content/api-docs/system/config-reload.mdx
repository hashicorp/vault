# `/sys/config/reload`

@include 'alerts/restricted-root.mdx'

The `sys/config/reload` endpoint allows reloading specific parts of Vault's configuration.
Currently, it only supports reloading license information from files on disk.

| Method | Path                          |
| :----- | :---------------------------- |
| `POST` | `/sys/config/reload/:subsystem` |

### Parameters

- `subsystem` `(string: <required>)` - Specifies the subsystem for Vault to reload. This is part of the request URL.

## Reload license file <EnterpriseAlert product="vault" inline />

When the `:subsystem` URL parameter is specified as `license`, Vault re-reads
the license file if the license was provided using the `license_path` configuration
option or the `VAULT_LICENSE_PATH` environment variable.  The updated license is
applied to Vault, and Vault will then enable/disable licensed features if the features
of the given license are different from those of the license Vault is currently using.

### Sample request

```shell-session
$ curl \
  -X POST \
  --header "X-Vault-Token: ..." \
    'http://127.0.0.1:8200/v1/sys/config/reload/license'
```
