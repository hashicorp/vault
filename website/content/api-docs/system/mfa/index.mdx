# `/sys/mfa`

@include 'alerts/restricted-root.mdx'

The `/sys/mfa` endpoint focuses on managing Multi-factor Authentication (MFA)
behaviors in Vault Enterprise MFA.

## Supported MFA types

- [TOTP](/vault/api-docs/system/mfa/totp)

- [Okta](/vault/api-docs/system/mfa/okta)

- [Duo](/vault/api-docs/system/mfa/duo)

- [PingID](/vault/api-docs/system/mfa/pingid)

## Step-up enterprise MFA

[Vault Enterprise](/vault/docs/enterprise/mfa) allows MFA for login and access to
sensitive resources in Vault.  The Step-up Enterprise MFA expects the method
creator to specify a name for the method; Login MFA does not, and instead
returns an ID when a method is created. Although MFA methods supported with Step-up Enterprise MFA are supported with the Login MFA, they use different API endpoints.

- Step-up Enterprise MFA: `sys/mfa/method/:type/:/name`
- Login MFA: `identity/mfa/method/:type`

~> **Note:** While the `sys/mfa` endpoint is supported for both Vault Community and Enterprise editions, `sys/mfa/method/:type/:/name` is only supported for Vault Enterprise.
