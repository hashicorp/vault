# `/sys/internal/counters`

The `/sys/internal/counters` endpoints are used to return data about the number of Tokens and Entities in Vault. They return information for the entire cluster.

~> **NOTE**: These endpoints are only available in Vault version 1.3+. Backwards compatibility is not guaranteed. These endpoints are subject to change or may disappear without notice.

## Client count

@include 'alerts/restricted-admin.mdx'

This endpoint returns client activity information for a given billing
period, which is represented by the `start_time` and `end_time` parameters.

There are a few things to keep in mind while using this API.

- For Vault versions before 1.11, the activity information only accounts for
the activity of the latest contiguous months in the billing period.
For example, if the billing period is from Jan 2022 to June 2022, and the
activity subsystem in Vault was not capturing data for the months Jan to March,
the response will only include information for May and June. Note that if no
`start_time` and `end_time` parameters are specified, the billing period defaults
to 12 months, so the endpoint will return activity information from the end of the
previous month to the start of 12 months prior to that date.

- As of 1.11, this behavior has been modified to return all available data within
the specified billing period.

- As of 1.12, the `end_time` can be the current month.

- The response contains the total activity for the billing period and the
attributions of the total activity against specific components in Vault. This
helps in understanding the total activity better by knowing which components in
Vault lead to that top-level activity count. First-level of attribution
breakdowns are by namespaces and months, under the `by_namespaces` and `months`
JSON block, respectively.

```json
{
   "by_namespace":[],
   "months":[],
}
```

- `by_namespaces` breakdowns provide attributions of each namespace to the total
activity count. Mount level attributions further break down these namespaces
attributions, wherein information can be found on the attributions of each mount
path within a given namespace to the overall activity of the namespace.

```json
{
   "by_namespace":[
      {
         "namespace_id":"root",
         "namespace_path":"",
         "counts":{},
         "mounts":[
            {
               "path":"auth/up1/",
               "counts":{}
            },
            {
               "path":"auth/up2/",
               "counts":{}
            }
         ]
      }
   ]
}
```

- `months` breakdowns provide attributions of each month to the total activity
count. These month-level attributions are further broken down into namespace and mount
level attributions for each month.

```json
{
   "months":[
      {
         "timestamp":"2021-05-01T00:00:00Z",
         "counts":{},
         "namespaces":[
            {
               "namespace_id":"root",
               "namespace_path":"",
               "counts":{},
               "mounts":[
                  {
                     "path":"auth/up2/",
                     "counts":{}
                  },
                  {
                     "path":"auth/up1/",
                     "counts":{}
                  }
               ]
            },
            {
               "namespace_id":"s07UR",
               "namespace_path":"ns1/",
               "counts":{},
               "mounts":[
                  {
                     "path":"auth/up1/",
                     "counts":{}
                  },
                  {
                     "path":"auth/up2/",
                     "counts":{}
                  }
               ]
            }
         ],
         "new_clients":{}
      }
   ],
}
```

- Each entry in the `months` breakdown contains a `new_clients` block. When a
token is first used within a billing period, it is considered a new client for
that billing period. This means that all the active clients in the first month
of the billing period will be considered new clients for that billing period.
While these tokens could be generated and counted in the previous billing
period, they are still considered new clients in the context of the given
billing period. For each subsequent month in the same billing period, the tokens
used in those months that were unused in previous months of the same billing
period are considered new clients for that month. Hence, the computation of new
clients differs for each combination of `start_time` and `end_time`.

- The `new_clients` block within the `months` breakdown will also be further
broken down by namespaces and mounts for visibility into which components in
Vault lead to the new clients for each month.

```json
{
   "months":[
      {
         "new_clients":{
            "counts":{},
            "namespaces":[
               {
                  "namespace_id":"root",
                  "namespace_path":"",
                  "counts":{},
                  "mounts":[
                     {
                        "path":"auth/up2/",
                        "counts":{}
                     },
                     {
                        "path":"auth/up1/",
                        "counts":{}
                     }
                  ]
               }
            ]
         }
      }
   ],
}
```

- The `distinct_entities` field name has been deprecated since Vault 1.10. Refer to
`entity_clients` field instead. The `distinct_entities` field is currently
returned by the API for backward compatibility and it may be removed in the future.

- The `non_entity_tokens` field name has been deprecated since Vault 1.10. Refer to
`non_entity_clients` field instead. The `non_entity_tokens` field is currently
returned by the API for backward compatibility, and it may be removed in the future.

- If the `end_date` supplied to the API is for the current month, the activity
information returned by this API will only be till the previous month. The
activity system is designed to process the accumulated activity only at the end
of the month. Since the system does not fully process the current month's
information, it will not be added to the API response.

- The response includes the actual time period covered, which may not exactly
match the query parameters due to the month granularity of data or missing
months in the requested time range.

- Note that if the `end_date` specified is the current month,
the last element in the `months` response stanza, signifying the current month, will
not have namespace attribution for the `new_clients` stanza. Furthermore, the
`new_clients` counts returned for the current month will be an approximation.
That is to say, the response will appear as follows.

```json

   "months":[
      {
         "timestamp":"current_month_timestamp",
         "counts":{

Please visit the [client count](/vault/docs/concepts/client-count) concepts page for
more information on how clients map to these client IDs and how they are
counted, or for more information about how the new clients for the current month
are estimated in a billing period.

The response will include all child namespaces of the namespace in which the
request was made. If some namespace has subsequently been deleted, its path will
be listed as "deleted namespace :ID:." Deleted namespaces are reported only for
queries in the root namespace because the information about the namespace path
is unknown.

This endpoint was added in Vault 1.6.

| Method | Path                              |
| :----- | :-------------------------------- |
| `GET`  | `/sys/internal/counters/activity` |

### Parameters

- `start_time` `(string, optional)` - An RFC3339 timestamp or Unix epoch time. Specifies the start of the
  period for which client counts will be reported. If no start time is specified, the `default_report_months`
  prior to the `end_time` will be used.
- `end_time` `(string, optional)` - An RFC3339 timestamp or Unix epoch time. Specifies the end of the period
  for which client counts will be reported. If no end time is specified, the end of the previous calendar
  month will be used.
- `limit_namespaces` `(int, optional)` - Controls the total number of by_namespace data returned. This can
   be used to return the client counts for the specified number of namespaces having highest activity.
   If no `limit_namespaces` parameter is specified, client counts for all namespaces in specified usage period is returned.
- `current_billing_period` `(bool, optional)` - Uses the builtin billing start
  timestamp as `start_time` and the current time as the `end_time`, returning a
  response with the current billing period information without having to
  explicitly provide a start and end time.

### Sample request to get client counts for top 2 namespaces with highest activity for a usage period

```shell-session
$ curl \
    --header "X-Vault-Token: ..." \
    --request GET \
    http://127.0.0.1:8200/v1/sys/internal/counters/activity?end_time=2020-06-30T00%3A00%3A00Z&start_time=2020-06-01T00%3A00%3A00Z&limit_namespaces=2
```

## Partial month client count

@include 'alerts/restricted-admin.mdx'

This endpoint returns the client activity in the current month. The response
will have activity attributions per namespace, per mount within each namespaces,
and new clients information.

The time period is from the start of the current month, up until the time that
this request was made.

Note: the client count may be inaccurate in the moments following a Vault
reboot, or leadership change. The estimate will stabilize when background
loading of client data has completed.

This endpoint was added in Vault 1.7.

## Update the client count configuration

@include 'alerts/restricted-admin.mdx'

The `/sys/internal/counters/config` endpoint is used to configure logging of active clients.

| Method | Path                            |
| :----- | :------------------------------ |
| `POST` | `/sys/internal/counters/config` |

### Parameters

- `default_report_months` `(integer: 12)` - The number of months to report if no `start_time` is specified in a query.
- `enabled` `(string: enable, disable, default)` - Enable or disable counting of client activity. When set to `default`, the client
  counts are enabled on Enterprise builds and disabled on community builds. Disabling the feature during the middle of a month will
  discard any data recorded for that month, but does not delete previous months.
- `retention_months` `(integer: 24)` - The number of months of history to retain.

Any missing parameters are left at their existing value.

### Sample payload

```json
{
  "enabled": "enable",
  "default_report_months": 3,
  "retention_months": 12
}
```

### Sample request

```shell-session
$ curl \
    --request POST
    --header "X-Vault-Token: ..." \
    --data @payload.json
    http://127.0.0.1:8200/v1/sys/internal/counters/config
```

## Read the client count configuration

@include 'alerts/restricted-admin.mdx'

Reading the configuration shows the current settings, as well as a flag as to whether any data can be queried.

- `enabled` `(string)` - returns `default-enabled` or `default-disabled` if the configuration is `default`.
- `queries_available` `(bool)` - indicates whether any usage report is available. This will initially be
  false until the end of the first calendar month after the feature is enabled.

### Sample request

```shell-session
$ curl \
    --request GET
    --header "X-Vault-Token: ..." \
    http://127.0.0.1:8200/v1/sys/internal/counters/config
```

### Sample response

```json
{
  "request_id": "25a94b99-b49a-c4ac-cb7b-5ba0eb390a25",
  "lease_id": "",
  "lease_duration": 0,
  "renewable": false,
  "data": {
    "default_report_months": 12,
    "enabled": "default-enabled",
    "queries_available": true,
    "retention_months": 24,
    "reporting_enabled": false,
    "billing_start_timestamp": "2022-03-01T00:00:00Z",
  },
  "warnings": null
}
```

## Activity export

@include 'alerts/restricted-admin.mdx'

This endpoint returns an export of the clients that had activity within the
provided start and end times. The returned set of client information will be
deduplicated over the time window and will show the earliest activity logged for
each client. The output will be ordered chronologically by month of activity.

~> **NOTE**: This endpoint is currently in tech preview status.

There are a few things to keep in mind while using this API.

- The response includes the actual time period covered, which may not exactly
match the query parameters due to the month granularity of data or missing
months in the requested time range.

- If the `end_date` supplied to the API is for the current month, the activity
information returned by this API will include activity for this month, however
it may be up to 20 minutes delayed.

This endpoint was added in Vault 1.11.

| Method | Path                                      |
| :----- | :---------------------------------------- |
| `GET`  | `/sys/internal/counters/activity/export` |

### Parameters

- `start_time` `(string, optional)` - An RFC3339 timestamp or Unix epoch time. Specifies the start of the
  period for which client counts will be reported. If no start time is specified, the `default_report_months`
  prior to the `end_time` will be used.
- `end_time` `(string, optional)` - An RFC3339 timestamp or Unix epoch time. Specifies the end of the period
  for which client counts will be reported. If no end time is specified, the end of the previous calendar
  month will be used.
- `format` `(string, optional)` - The desired format of the output file. Allowed
    values are `csv` and `json`. If no format is provided a default of `json`
    will be used.

### Sample request

```shell-session
$ curl \
    --header "X-Vault-Token: ..." \
    --request GET \
    http://127.0.0.1:8200/v1/sys/internal/counters/activity/export
```
