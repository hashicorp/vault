# `/sys/init`

The `/sys/init` endpoint is used to initialize a new Vault.

## Read initialization status

This endpoint returns the initialization status of Vault.

| Method | Path        |
| :----- | :---------- |
| `GET`  | `/sys/init` |

### Sample request

```shell-session
$ curl \
    http://127.0.0.1:8200/v1/sys/init
```

### Sample response

```json
{
  "initialized": true
}
```

## Start initialization

This endpoint initializes a new Vault. The Vault must not have been previously
initialized. The recovery options, as well as the stored shares option, are only
available when using [Auto Unseal](/vault/docs/concepts/seal#auto-unseal).

| Method | Path        |
| :----- | :---------- |
| `POST`  | `/sys/init` |

### Parameters

- `pgp_keys` `(array<string>: nil)` – Specifies an array of PGP public keys used
  to encrypt the output unseal keys. Ordering is preserved. The keys must be
  base64-encoded from their original binary representation. The size of this
  array must be the same as `secret_shares`.

- `root_token_pgp_key` `(string: "")` – Specifies a PGP public key used to
  encrypt the initial root token. The key must be base64-encoded from its
  original binary representation.

- `secret_shares` `(int: <required>)` – Specifies the number of shares to
  split the root key into.

- `secret_threshold` `(int: <required>)` – Specifies the number of shares
  required to reconstruct the root key. This must be less than or equal
  `secret_shares`.

Additionally, the following options are only supported using Auto Unseal:

- `stored_shares` `(int: <required>)` – Specifies the number of shares that
  should be encrypted by the HSM and stored for auto-unsealing. Currently must
  be the same as `secret_shares`.

- `recovery_shares` `(int: 0)` – Specifies the number of shares to
  split the recovery key into. This is only available when using Auto Unseal.

- `recovery_threshold` `(int: 0)` – Specifies the number of shares
  required to reconstruct the recovery key. This must be less than or equal to
  `recovery_shares`. This is only available when using Auto Unseal.

- `recovery_pgp_keys` `(array<string>: nil)` – Specifies an array of PGP public
  keys used to encrypt the output recovery keys. Ordering is preserved. The keys
  must be base64-encoded from their original binary representation. The size of
  this array must be the same as `recovery_shares`. This is only available when using Auto Unseal.

### Sample payload

```json
{
  "secret_shares": 10,
  "secret_threshold": 5
}
```

### Sample request

```shell-session
$ curl \
    --request POST \
    --data @payload.json \
    http://127.0.0.1:8200/v1/sys/init
```

### Sample response

A JSON-encoded object including the (possibly encrypted, if `pgp_keys` was
provided) root keys, base 64 encoded root keys and initial root token:

```json
{
  "keys": ["one", "two", "three"],
  "keys_base64": ["cR9No5cBC", "F3VLrkOo", "zIDSZNGv"],
  "root_token": "foo"
}
```

-> **Warning:** Please be reminded that recovery keys are used as an 
authentication flow for rekeying and regeneration of root credentials and cannot 
be used to unseal Vault in the case of the unavailability of the seal mechanism.
Refer to the full warning in the documentation for 
[Auto Unseal](/vault/docs/concepts/seal#auto-unseal).
