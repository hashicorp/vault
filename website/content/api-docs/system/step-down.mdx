# `/sys/step-down`

@include 'alerts/restricted-root.mdx'

The `/sys/step-down` endpoint causes the node to give up active status.

## Step down leader

The step-down endpoint forces nodes to give up "active" status. If you
call the endpoint against a non-active node, for example, a DR or
 performance standby node, Vault forwards the request to the active
  node.
  
    Note that the node will sleep
for ten seconds before attempting to grab the active lock again, but if no
standby nodes grab the active lock in the interim, the same node may become the
active node again. Requires a token with `root` policy or `sudo` capability on
the path.
