# `/sys/replication`

@include 'alerts/enterprise-and-hcp-plus.mdx'

## Attempt recovery

This endpoint attempts recovery if replication is in an adverse state. For
example: an error has caused replication to stop syncing.

| Method | Path                       |
| :----- | :------------------------- |
| `POST` | `/sys/replication/recover` |

### Sample request

```shell-session
$ curl \
    --header "X-Vault-Token: ..." \
    --request POST \
    http://127.0.0.1:8200/v1/sys/replication/recover
```

### Sample response

```json
{
  "warnings": ["..."]
}
```

## Reindex replication

This endpoint reindexes the local data storage. This can cause a very long delay
depending on the number and size of objects in the data store.

**This endpoint requires 'sudo' capability.**

| Method | Path                       |
| :----- | :------------------------- |
| `POST` | `/sys/replication/reindex` |

### Parameters

- `diff` `(bool: false)` – Enables a slower re-indexing which will perform a key
  level check to diagnose issues. Defaults false.

- `force` `(bool: false)` – Forces a complete re-indexing which only scans data
  available in the storage. Defaults false.

- `skip_flush` `(bool: false)` – Skips the tree flushing stage of the reindex
  process. This setting can be used to reduce the amount of time the tree is locked
  during a reindex process. If this node is killed before the full tree has been
  asynchronously flushed the reindex may not have applied fully and a new reindex
  may need to be done. Defaults false.

### Sample payload

```json
{}
```

### Sample request

```shell-session
$ curl \
    --header "X-Vault-Token: ..." \
    --request POST \
    http://127.0.0.1:8200/v1/sys/replication/reindex
```

### Sample response

```json
{
  "warnings": ["..."]
}
```

## Check status

This endpoint print information about the status of replication (mode,
sync progress, etc).

This is an unauthenticated endpoint.

| Method | Path                      |
| :----- | :------------------------ |
| `GET`  | `/sys/replication/status` |

### Sample request

```shell-session
$ curl \
    http://127.0.0.1:8200/v1/sys/replication/status
```

### Sample response

The printed status of the replication environment. As an example, for a
performance primary and DR primary node, it will look something like:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "dr": {
      "cluster_id": "f2c21cb5-523f-617b-20ac-c913d9154ba6",
      "known_secondaries": ["3"],
      "last_wal": 291,
      "merkle_root": "38543b95d44132138003939addbaf94125ec184e",
      "mode": "primary",
      "primary_cluster_addr": "",
      "secondaries": [
        {
          "api_address": "https://127.0.0.1:49264",
          "cluster_address": "https://127.0.0.1:49267",
          "connection_status": "connected",
          "last_heartbeat": "2020-06-10T15:40:47-07:00",
          "node_id": "3"
        }
      ]
    },
    "performance": {
      "cluster_id": "1598d434-dfec-1f48-f019-3d22a8075bf9",
      "known_secondaries": ["2"],
      "last_wal": 291,
      "merkle_root": "43f40fc775b40cc76cd5d7e289b2e6eaf4ba138c",
      "mode": "primary",
      "primary_cluster_addr": "",
      "secondaries": [
        {
          "api_address": "https://127.0.0.1:49253",
          "cluster_address": "https://127.0.0.1:49256",
          "connection_status": "connected",
          "last_heartbeat": "2020-06-10T15:40:46-07:00",
          "node_id": "2"
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

Possible values for `connection_status` are `connected` or `disconnected`. `last_heartbeat` is the timestamp of the
last time this node exchanged heartbeats with another node.

### Sample response from performance secondary & DR primary

The printed status of the replication environment. As an example, for a
performance secondary and DR primary node, it will look something like:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "dr": {
      "cluster_id": "e4bfa800-002e-7b6d-14c2-617855ece02f",
      "known_secondaries": ["4"],
      "last_wal": 455,
      "merkle_root": "cdcf796619240ce19dd8af30fa700f64c8006e3d",
      "mode": "primary",
      "primary_cluster_addr": "",
      "secondaries": [
        {
          "api_address": "https://127.0.0.1:49277",
          "cluster_address": "https://127.0.0.1:49281",
          "connection_status": "connected",
          "last_heartbeat": "2020-06-10T15:40:46-07:00",
          "node_id": "4"
        }
      ]
    },
    "performance": {
      "cluster_id": "1598d434-dfec-1f48-f019-3d22a8075bf9",
