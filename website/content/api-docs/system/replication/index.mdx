# `/sys/replication`

@include 'alerts/enterprise-only.mdx'

@include 'alerts/restricted-root.mdx'

## Attempt recovery

This endpoint attempts recovery if replication is in an adverse state. For
example: an error has caused replication to stop syncing.

| Method | Path                       |
| :----- | :------------------------- |
| `POST` | `/sys/replication/recover` |

### Sample request

```shell-session
$ curl \
    --header "X-Vault-Token: ..." \
    --request POST \
    http://127.0.0.1:8200/v1/sys/replication/recover
```

### Sample response

```json
{
  "warnings": ["..."]
}
```

## Reindex replication

This endpoint reindexes the local data storage. This can cause a very long delay
depending on the number and size of objects in the data store.

**This endpoint requires 'sudo' capability.**

| Method | Path                       |
| :----- | :------------------------- |
| `POST` | `/sys/replication/reindex` |

### Parameters

- `diff` `(bool: false)` – Enables a slower re-indexing which will perform a key
  level check to diagnose issues. Defaults false.

- `force` `(bool: false)` – Forces a complete re-indexing which only scans data
  available in the storage. Defaults false.

- `skip_flush` `(bool: false)` – Skips the tree flushing stage of the reindex
  process. This setting can be used to reduce the amount of time the tree is locked
  during a reindex process. If this node is killed before the full tree has been
  asynchronously flushed the reindex may not have applied fully and a new reindex
  may need to be done. Defaults false.

### Sample payload

```json
{}
```

### Sample request

```shell-session
$ curl \
    --header "X-Vault-Token: ..." \
    --request POST \
    http://127.0.0.1:8200/v1/sys/replication/reindex
```

### Sample response

```json
{
  "warnings": ["..."]
}
```

## Check status

This endpoint print information about the status of replication (mode,
sync progress, etc).

This is an unauthenticated endpoint.

| Method | Path                      |
| :----- | :------------------------ |
| `GET`  | `/sys/replication/status` |

### Sample request

```shell-session
$ curl \
    http://127.0.0.1:8200/v1/sys/replication/status
```

### Sample response

The printed status of the replication environment. As an example, for a
performance primary and DR primary node, it will look something like:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "dr": {
      "cluster_id": "f2c21cb5-523f-617b-20ac-c913d9154ba6",
      "known_secondaries": ["3"],
      "last_wal": 291,
      "merkle_root": "38543b95d44132138003939addbaf94125ec184e",
      "mode": "primary",
      "primary_cluster_addr": "",
      "secondaries": [
        {
          "api_address": "https://127.0.0.1:49264",
          "cluster_address": "https://127.0.0.1:49267",
          "connection_status": "connected",
          "last_heartbeat": "2020-06-10T15:40:47-07:00",
          "node_id": "3"
        }
      ]
    },
    "performance": {
      "cluster_id": "1598d434-dfec-1f48-f019-3d22a8075bf9",
      "known_secondaries": ["2"],
      "last_wal": 291,
      "merkle_root": "43f40fc775b40cc76cd5d7e289b2e6eaf4ba138c",
      "mode": "primary",
      "primary_cluster_addr": "",
      "secondaries": [
        {
          "api_address": "https://127.0.0.1:49253",
          "cluster_address": "https://127.0.0.1:49256",
          "connection_status": "connected",
          "last_heartbeat": "2020-06-10T15:40:46-07:00",
          "node_id": "2"
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

Possible values for `connection_status` are `connected` or `disconnected`. `last_heartbeat` is the timestamp of the
last time this node exchanged heartbeats with another node.

### Sample response from performance secondary & DR primary

The printed status of the replication environment. As an example, for a
performance secondary and DR primary node, it will look something like:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "dr": {
      "cluster_id": "e4bfa800-002e-7b6d-14c2-617855ece02f",

## `/sys/replication/merkle-check`

The Merkle check endpoint prints information about the corruption
status of the Merkle tree. The corruption information provides insight
about whether any current replication issues can be resolved by
reindexing the tree. We recommend consulting the Merkle check endpoint
**before** reindexing to ensure the process will be useful as  reindexing
can be time-consuming and lead to downtime.

You must provide an authentication token when calling `replication/merkle-check`.

| Method  | Path                            |
| :------ | :------------------------------ |
| `POST`  | `/sys/replication/merkle-check` |

### Sample request

```shell-session
$ curl \
    --header "X-Vault-Token: ..." \
    --request POST \
    http://127.0.0.1:8200/v1/sys/replication/merkle-check
```

### Sample response

The response provides information about the health of the Merkle composite tree.
The `merkle_corruption_report` stanza provides information about merkle tree
corruption.  The `corrupted_root` field indicates whether the root of the tree
is corrupted. The `corrupted_tree_map` field identifies any corruption in the
roots of its subtrees, including replicated and local subtrees. In the event of
corruption within a page or subpage of the tree, `corrupted_tree_map` includes
the page number along with a list of corrupted subpage numbers. The status details
indicate the extent of corruption within the merkle tree.
