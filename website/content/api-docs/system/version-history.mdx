# `/sys/version-history`

~> **NOTE**: Tracking Vault version history was added in Vault version 1.9.0. Entries for versions installed prior to version 1.9.0 will not be available via this API.
This API was added in 1.10.0.

The `/sys/version-history` endpoint is used to retrieve the version history of a Vault.

## Read version history

This endpoint returns the version history of the Vault. The response will contain the following keys:

- `keys`: a list of installed versions in chronological order based on the time installed
- `key_info`: a map indexed by the versions found in the `keys` list containing the following subkeys:
  - `build_date`: the time (in UTC) at which the Vault binary used to run the Vault server was built. **Note: Only tracked from version 1.11.0 or greater**
  - `previous_version`: the version installed prior to this version or `null` if no prior version exists
  - `timestamp_installed`: the time (in UTC) at which the version was installed
