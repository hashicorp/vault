- `keys`: a list of installed versions in chronological order based on the time installed
- `key_info`: a map indexed by the versions found in the `keys` list containing the following subkeys:
  - `previous_version`: the version installed prior to this version or `null` if no prior version exists
  - `timestamp_installed`: the time (in UTC) at which the version was installed
