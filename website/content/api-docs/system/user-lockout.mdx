# `/sys/locked-users`

The `/sys/locked-users` endpoint is used to list and unlock locked users in Vault.

Refer to the [user lockout](/vault/docs/concepts/user-lockout) overview for more details about how Vault handles lockouts.

## List locked users

The list endpoint returns information on the users currently locked by Vault.

The response will include all child namespaces of the namespace in which the
request was made. If some namespace has subsequently been deleted, its path will
be listed as "deleted namespace :ID:." Deleted namespaces are reported only for
queries in the root namespace because the information about the namespace path
is unknown. The response will be returned in the decreasing order of locked user
counts.

This endpoint was added in Vault 1.13.

| Method | Path             |
| :----- | :--------------- |
| `GET` | `/sys/locked-users` |

### Parameters

- `mount_accessor` `(string, optional)` -  Specifies the identifier of the auth mount entry to which the user
belongs in the namespace in which the request was made. If no mount accessor is specified,
the response includes locked users in all child namespaces of the namespace in which the request was made.

### Sample request

```shell-session
$ curl \
    --header "X-Vault-Token: ..." \
    --request GET \
    http://127.0.0.1:8200/v1/sys/locked-users

### Sample request with mount accessor

#### Sample payload

```json
{
  "mount_accessor": "auth_userpass_af8d1d32"
}
```

#### Sample request

```shell-session
$ curl \
    --header "X-Vault-Token: ..." \
    --data @payload.json \
    --request GET \
    http://127.0.0.1:8200/v1/sys/locked-users

## Unlock user

The unlock user endpoint frees a locked user with the provided `mount_accessor` and `alias_identifier` in the given namespace.
The unlock command is idempotent. Calls to the endpoint succeed even if the user matching the provided `mount_accessor` and `alias_identifier` is not currently locked.


This endpoint was added in Vault 1.13.

| Method | Path             |
| :----- | :--------------- |
| `POST` | `/sys/locked-users/:mount_accessor/unlock/:alias-identifier` |

### Parameters

- `mount_accessor` `(string, required)` - Specifies the identifier of the auth mount entry to which the user
belongs
- `alias_identifier` `(string, required)` - The name of the alias (user). For example, if the alias
belongs to userpass backend, the name should be a valid username within userpass auth method. If the alias belongs
to an approle auth method, the name should be a valid RoleID. If the alias belongs to an ldap auth method, the name
should be a valid username.

### Sample request

```shell-session
$ curl \
    --header "X-Vault-Token: ..." \
    --request POST \
    http://127.0.0.1:8200/v1/sys/locked-users/auth_userpass_af8d1d32/unlock/bsmith
