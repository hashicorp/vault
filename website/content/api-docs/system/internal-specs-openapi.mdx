# `/sys/internal/specs/openapi`

The `/sys/internal/specs/openapi` endpoint is used to generate an OpenAPI document of the mounted backends.
The response conforms to the [OpenAPI V3 specification](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/3.0.2.md),
with path names matching the mount names used by the Vault server (i.e. customizations with `-path` will be reflected).
The set of included paths is based on the permissions of the request token.

The response may include Vault-specific [extensions](https://github.com/oai/openapi-specification/blob/master/versions/3.0.2.md#specification-extensions). Three are currently defined:

- `x-vault-sudo` - Endpoint requires [sudo](/vault/docs/concepts/policies#sudo) privileges.
- `x-vault-unauthenticated` - Endpoint is unauthenticated.
- `x-vault-create-supported` - Endpoint allows creation of new items, in addition to updating existing items.

Basic documentation will be generated for all paths, but a newer path definition structure now allows for
more detailed documentation to be added. At this time the `/sys` endpoints have been updated to use the new
structure, and other endpoints will be modified incrementally.

## Get OpenAPI document

This endpoint returns a single OpenAPI document describing all paths visible to the requester.

| Method | Path                          |
