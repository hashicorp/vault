# `/sys/internal/ui/namespaces`

The `/sys/internal/ui/namespaces` endpoint is used to expose namespaces
to the GUI so that it can change its behavior in response, even before a user logs in.

This is currently only being used internally for the UI and is
an unauthenticated endpoint. Due to the nature of its intended usage, there is no
guarantee on backwards compatibility for this endpoint.

## Get namespaces

This endpoint lists the namespaces relevant to the GUI.

| Method | Path                             |
| :----- | :------------------------------- |
| `GET`  | `/sys/internal/ui/namespaces` |

### Sample request

```shell-session
$ curl \
    --header "X-Vault-Token: ..." \
    --request GET \
    http://127.0.0.1:8200/v1/sys/internal/ui/namespaces
```

### Sample response

```json
{
    "request_id": "28a1ca80-cc97-913d-8ed2-844ea501ae0d",
    "lease_id": "",
    "renewable": false,
    "lease_duration": 0,
    "data": {
        "keys": [
            "parent/",
            "parent/child/",
            "parent/child/grandchild/",
            "parent2/"
        ]
    },
    "wrap_info": null,
    "warnings": null,
    "auth": null,
    "mount_type": ""
}
```

The `keys` array in the response lists all available namespaces, with each entry representing a namespace path.

In the sample response above:
- `parent/` is a namespace that contains a nested namespace `child/`.
- `parent/child/` is a nested namespace under `parent/` and contains its own nested namespace `grandchild/`.
- `parent/child/grandchild/` is a nested namespace under `parent/child/`.
- `parent2/` is a namespace that does not have any nested namespaces.

> **Note:** The `root` namespace is never included in this list of namespaces.
