  certificates in vault

# pki verify-sign

This command verifies whether the listed issuer has signed the listed issued
certificate.

This command returns five fields of information:

- `signature_match`: was the key of the issuer used to sign the issued.

- `path_match`: the possible issuer appears in the valid certificate chain
	of the issued.

- `key_id_match`: does the [key id](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5280#section-4.2.1.1)
  of the issuer match the key_id of the subject.

- `subject_match`: does the subject name of the issuer match the issuer
	subject of the issued.

- `trust_match`: if someone trusted the parent issuer, is the chain
  provided sufficient to trust the child issued.

## Usage

Usage: `vault pki verify-sign <parent> <child>`

- `<parent>` is the fully name-spaced path to the issuer certificate which will be
used to verify the `<child>` certificate

- `<child>` is the fully name-spaced path to the potential child-certificate to be
verified

A fully namespaced path looks like, for instance, 'ns1/mount1/issuer/issuerName/json'.

## Example

```shell-session
$ vault pki verify-sign pki_root/issuer/root pki_int/issuer/FirstDepartment
issuer:pki_root/issuer/root
issued:pki_int/issuer/FirstDepartment
