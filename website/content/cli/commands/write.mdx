# write

The `write` command writes data to Vault at the given path (wrapper command for
HTTP PUT or POST). The data can be credentials, secrets, configuration, or
arbitrary data. The specific behavior of the `write` command is determined at
the thing mounted at the path.

Data is specified as "**key=value**" pairs on the command line. If the value begins
with an "**@**", then it is loaded from a file. If the value for a key is "**-**", Vault
will read the value from stdin rather than the command line.

Some API fields require more advanced structures such as maps. These cannot
directly be represented on the command line. However, direct control of the
request parameters can be achieved by using `-` as the only data argument.
This causes `vault write` to read a JSON blob containing all request parameters
from stdin. This argument will be ignored if used in conjunction with any
"key=value" pairs.

For a full list of examples and paths, please see the documentation that
corresponds to the secrets engines in use.

## Examples

Store an arbitrary secrets in the token's cubbyhole.

```shell-session
$ vault write cubbyhole/git-credentials username="student01" password="p@$$w0rd"
```

Create a new encryption key in the transit secrets engine:

```shell-session
$ vault write -force transit/keys/my-key
```

The `-force` flag allows the write operation without input data. (See [command
options](#command-options).)

Upload an AWS IAM policy from a file on disk:

```shell-session
$ vault write aws/roles/ops policy=@policy.json
```

Configure access to Consul by providing an access token:

```shell-session
$ echo $MY_TOKEN | vault write consul/config/access token=-
```

Set role-level TTL values for a user named "alice" so the generated lease has a
default TTL of 8 hours (28800 seconds) and maximum TTL of 12 hours
(43200 seconds):

```shell-session
$ VAULT_TOKEN=$VAULT_TOKEN vault write /auth/userpass/users/alice \
    token_ttl="8h" token_max_ttl="12h"
```

### API versus CLI

Create a token with TTL set to 8 hours, limited to 3 uses, and attach `admin`
and `secops` policies.

```shell-session
$ vault write auth/token/create policies="admin" policies="secops" ttl=8h num_uses=3
```

Equivalent cURL command for this operation:

```shell-session
$ tee request_payload.json -<<EOF
{
   "policies": ["admin", "secops"],
   "ttl": "8h",
   "num_uses": 3
}
EOF

$ curl --header "X-Vault-Token: $VAULT_TOKEN" \
    --request POST \
    --data @request_payload.json \
    $VAULT_ADDR/v1/auth/token/create
```

The `vault write` command simplifies the API call.

Since token management is a common task, Vault CLI provides a
[`token`](/vault/docs/commands/token) command with
[`create`](/vault/docs/commands/token/create) subcommand. The CLI command simplifies
the token creation. Use the `vault create` command with options to set the token
TTL, policies, and use limit.

```shell-session
$ vault token create -policy=admin -policy=secops -ttl=8h -use-limit=3
```

-> **Syntax:** The command options start with `-` (e.g. `-ttl`) while API path
parameters do not (e.g. `ttl`). You always set the API parameters after the path
you are invoking.

## Usage

The following flags are available in addition to the [standard set of
flags](/vault/docs/commands) included on all commands.

### Output options

- `-field` `(string: "")` - Print only the field with the given name, in the format
  specified in the `-format` directive. The result will not have a trailing
  newline making it ideal for piping to other processes.

- `-format` `(string: "table")` - Print the output in the given format. Valid
  formats are "table", "json", or "yaml". This can also be specified via the
  `VAULT_FORMAT` environment variable.

### Command options

- `-force` `(bool: false)` - Allow the operation to continue with no key=value
  pairs. This allows writing to keys that do not need or expect data. This is
  aliased as `-f`.
