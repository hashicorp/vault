# license get

The `license get` command reports on the license in use.  With the `-signed`
flag, it will return the actual license string, but only if the license
is stored, as opposed to [autoloaded](/vault/docs/enterprise/license/autoloading).

## Examples

Describe current license:

```shell-session
$ vault license get
Key                          Value
---                          -----

termination_time             2031-05-17T23:59:59Z
```

Get stored license string:

```shell-session
$ vault license get -signed
02MV4UU43BK5H...
```

Try to get stored license string when using autoloading:

```shell-session
$ vault license get -signed
License not found or using a temporary license.
```

## Usage

The following flags are available in addition to the [standard set of
flags](/vault/docs/commands) included on all commands.

### Command options

- `-signed` `(bool: false)` - Return the signed license string when using a
stored license.
