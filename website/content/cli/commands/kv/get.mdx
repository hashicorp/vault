# kv get

The `kv get` command retrieves the value from KV secrets engine at the given
key name. If no key exists with that name, an error is returned. If a key exists
with the name but has no data, nothing is returned.

## Examples

Retrieve the data of the key "creds":

```shell-session
$ vault kv get -mount=secret creds
== Secret Path ==
secret/data/creds

======= Metadata =======
Key                Value
---                -----
created_time       2022-06-15T20:23:40.067093Z
custom_metadata    <nil>
deletion_time      n/a
destroyed          false
version            1

====== Data ======
Key         Value
---         -----
passcode    my-long-passcode
```

If KV version 1 secrets engine is enabled at "secret", the output has no
metadata since there is no versioning information associated with the data:

```shell-session
$ vault kv get -mount=secret creds
====== Data ======
Key         Value
---         -----
passcode    my-long-passcode
```

Return only the "creds" "passcode" key:

```shell-session
$ vault kv get -mount=secret -field=passcode creds
my-long-passcode
```

## Usage

### Output options

- `-field` `(string: "")` - Print only the field with the given name. Specifying
  this option will take precedence over other formatting directives. The result
  will not have a trailing newline making it ideal for piping to other
  processes.

- `-format` `(string: "table")` - Print the output in the given format. Valid
  formats are "table", "json", or "yaml". This can also be specified via the
  `VAULT_FORMAT` environment variable.

### Command options

- `-mount` `(string: "")` - Specifies the path where the KV backend is mounted. 
  If specified, the next argument will be interpreted as the secret path. If 
  this flag is not specified, the next argument will be interpreted as the 
  combined mount path and secret path, with /data/ automatically inserted for 
  KV v2 secrets.

- `-version` `(int: 0)` - Specifies the version to return. If not set the
  latest version is returned.
