# kv

The `kv` command groups subcommands for interacting with Vault's key/value
secrets engine (both [KV version 1](/vault/docs/secrets/kv/kv-v1) and [KV
Version 2](/vault/docs/secrets/kv/kv-v2).

## Syntax

Option flags for a given subcommand are provided after the subcommand, but before the arguments.

The path to where the secrets engine is mounted can be indicated with the `-mount` flag, such as `vault kv get -mount=secret creds`.

The deprecated path-like syntax can also be used (e.g. `vault kv get secret/creds`), but this should be avoided
for KV v2, because it is not actually the full API path to the secret 
(secret/data/foo) and may cause confusion.

~> A `flag provided but not defined: -mount` error means you are using an older version of Vault before the 
mount flag syntax was introduced. Upgrade to at least Vault 1.11, or refer to previous versions of the docs 
which only use the old syntax to refer to the mount path.

## Mount flag syntax (KV)

All `kv` commands can alternatively refer to the path to the KV secrets engine using a flag-based syntax like `$ vault kv get -mount=secret password`
instead of `$ vault kv get secret/password`. The mount flag syntax was created to mitigate confusion caused by the fact that for KV v2 secrets,
their full path (used in policies and raw API calls) actually contains a nested `/data/` element (e.g. `secret/data/password`) which can be easily overlooked when using
the above KV v1-like syntax `secret/password`. To avoid this confusion, all KV-specific docs pages will use the `-mount` flag.

## Exit codes

The Vault CLI aims to be consistent and well-behaved unless documented
otherwise.

- Local errors such as incorrect flags, failed validations, or wrong numbers
  of arguments return an exit code of 1.

- Any remote errors such as API failures, bad TLS, or incorrect API parameters
  return an exit status of 2

Some commands override this default where it makes sense. These commands
document this anomaly.


## Examples

Create or update the key named "creds" in the KV version 2 enabled at "secret"
with the value "passcode=my-long-passcode":

```shell-session
$ vault kv put -mount=secret creds passcode=my-long-passcode
== Secret Path ==
secret/data/creds

======= Metadata =======
Key                Value
---                -----
created_time       2022-06-15T20:14:17.107852Z
custom_metadata    <nil>
deletion_time      n/a
destroyed          false
version            1
```

Read this value back:

```shell-session
$ vault kv get -mount=secret creds
== Secret Path ==
secret/data/creds

======= Metadata =======
Key                Value
---                -----
created_time       2022-06-15T20:14:17.107852Z
custom_metadata    <nil>
deletion_time      n/a
destroyed          false
version            1

====== Data ======
Key         Value
---         -----
passcode    my-long-passcode
```

Get metadata for the key named "creds":

```shell-session
$ vault kv metadata get -mount=secret creds
=== Metadata Path ===
secret/metadata/creds

========== Metadata ==========
Key                     Value
---                     -----
cas_required            false
created_time            2022-06-15T20:14:17.107852Z
current_version         1
custom_metadata         <nil>
delete_version_after    0s
max_versions            0
oldest_version          0
updated_time            2022-06-15T20:14:17.107852Z

====== Version 1 ======
Key              Value
---              -----
created_time     2022-06-15T20:14:17.107852Z
deletion_time    n/a
destroyed        false
```

Get a specific version of the key named "creds":

```shell-session
$ vault kv get -mount=secret -version=1 creds
== Secret Path ==
secret/data/creds

======= Metadata =======
Key                Value
---                -----
created_time       2022-06-15T20:14:17.107852Z
custom_metadata    <nil>
deletion_time      n/a
destroyed          false
version            1

====== Data ======
Key         Value
---         -----
passcode    my-long-passcode
```
