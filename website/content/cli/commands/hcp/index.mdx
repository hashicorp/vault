# hcp

Use `hcp` commands to manage authentication to HCP via proxy,
which allows clients to connect to this cluster securely over the internet with a proxy address and to invalidate any live authentication session.

## Examples

Connect to HCP:

```shell-session
$ vault hcp connect
The default web browser has been opened at <auth_url>. Please continue the login in the web browser.
Success!
```

Disconnect from HCP:
```shell-session
$ vault hcp disconnect
```
