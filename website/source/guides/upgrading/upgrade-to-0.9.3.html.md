# Overview

Due to a rapid release following 0.9.2, there are no version-specific upgrade
instructions although any upgrade notices for 0.9.2 apply if you are coming
from a previous version.

Please see the [0.9.2 upgrade guide](/guides/upgrading/upgrade-to-0.9.2.html) for notes on upgrading to 0.9.3.
