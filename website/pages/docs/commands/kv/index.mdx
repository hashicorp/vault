# kv

The `kv` command groups subcommands for interacting with Vault's key/value
secrets engine (both [K/V Version 1](/docs/secrets/kv/kv-v1) and [K/V
Version 2](/docs/secrets/kv/kv-v2).

## Examples

Create or update the key named "creds" in the K/V Version 2 enabled at "secret"
with the value "passcode=my-long-passcode":

```shell-session
$ vault kv put secret/creds passcode=my-long-passcode
Key              Value
---              -----
created_time     2019-06-28T15:53:30.395814Z
deletion_time    n/a
destroyed        false
version          1
```

Read this value back:

```shell-session
$ vault kv get secret/creds
====== Metadata ======
Key              Value
---              -----
created_time     2019-06-28T15:53:30.395814Z
deletion_time    n/a
destroyed        false
version          1

====== Data ======
Key         Value
---         -----
passcode    my-long-passcode
```

Get metadata for the key named "creds":

```shell-session
$ vault kv metadata get secret/creds
========== Metadata ==========
Key                     Value
---                     -----
cas_required            false
created_time            2019-06-28T15:53:30.395814Z
current_version         1
delete_version_after    0s
max_versions            0
oldest_version          0
updated_time            2019-06-28T15:53:30.395814Z

====== Version 1 ======
Key              Value
---              -----
created_time     2019-06-28T15:53:30.395814Z
deletion_time    n/a
destroyed        false
```

Get a specific version of the key named "creds":

```shell-session
$ vault kv get -version=1 secret/creds
====== Metadata ======
Key              Value
---              -----
