# plugin deregister

The `plugin deregister` command deregisters an existing plugin from Vault's
plugin catalog. If the plugin does not exist, no error is returned. The plugin's
type of "auth", "database", or "secret" must be included.

## Examples

Deregister a plugin:

```shell-session
$ vault plugin deregister auth my-custom-plugin
Success! Deregistered plugin (if it was registered): my-custom-plugin
```

## Usage

There are no flags beyond the [standard set of flags](/docs/commands)
included on all commands.
