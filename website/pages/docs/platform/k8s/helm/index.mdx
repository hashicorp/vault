# Helm Chart

~> **Important Note:** This chart is not compatible with Helm 2. Please use Helm 3 with this chart.

The [Vault Helm chart](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault-helm)
is the recommended way to install and configure Vault on Kubernetes.
In addition to running Vault itself, the Helm chart is the primary
method for installing and configuring Vault to integrate with other
services such as Consul for High Availability (HA) deployments.

This page assumes general knowledge of [Helm](https://helm.sh/) and
how to use it. Using Helm to install Vault requires that Helm is
properly installed and configured with your Kubernetes cluster.

## Using the Helm Chart

Helm must be installed and configured on your machine. Please refer to the [Helm
documentation](https://helm.sh/) or the [Vault Installation to Minikube via
Helm](https://learn.hashicorp.com/vault/getting-started-k8s/minikube) guide.

To use the Helm chart, you can target a specific [release published to
GitHub](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault-helm/releases) or download/clone the
[vault-helm GitHub repository](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault-helm). In the
future, we plan publishing to a public Helm repository.

-> **Important:** The Helm chart is new and under significant development.
Please always run Helm with `--dry-run` before any install or upgrade to verify
changes.

Example chart usage:

Installing the Vault Helm chart version 0.5.0 with pods prefixed with the name
`vault`.

```sh
$ helm install vault https://github.com/hashicorp/vault-helm/archive/v0.5.0.tar.gz
```

Cloning the Vault Helm chart, checking out tagged version v0.5.0, and installing
the Vault Helm chart from the filesystem.

~> **NOTE:** We highly recommend you checkout a specific tagged release
of the chart to avoid any instabilities from master.

```sh
# Clone the chart repo
$ git clone https://github.com/hashicorp/vault-helm.git
$ cd vault-helm

# Checkout a tagged version
$ git checkout v0.5.0

# Run Helm
$ helm install vault ./
```

~> **Security Warning:** By default, the chart runs in standalone mode. This
mode uses a single Vault server with a file storage backend. This is a less
secure and less resilent installation that is **NOT** appropriate for a
production setup. It is highly recommended to use a [properly secured Kubernetes
cluster](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/securing-a-cluster/),
[learn the available configuration
options](/docs/platform/k8s/helm/configuration), and read the [production deployment
checklist](/docs/platform/k8s/helm/run#architecture).

## Learn

Refer to the [Run Vault on
Kubernetes](https://learn.hashicorp.com/vault?track=getting-started-k8s#getting-started-k8s)
guides for step-by-step tutorials.
