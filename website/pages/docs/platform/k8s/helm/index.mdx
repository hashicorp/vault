# Helm Chart

~> **Important Note:** This chart is not compatible with Helm 2. Please use Helm 3 with this chart.

The [Vault Helm chart](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault-helm)
is the recommended way to install and configure Vault on Kubernetes.
In addition to running Vault itself, the Helm chart is the primary
method for installing and configuring Vault to integrate with other
services such as Consul for High Availability deployments.

This page assumes general knowledge of [Helm](https://helm.sh/) and
how to use it. Using Helm to install Vault will require that Helm is
properly installed and configured with your Kubernetes cluster.

-> **Important:** The Helm chart is new and
may still change significantly over time. Please always run Helm with
`--dry-run` before any install or upgrade to verify changes.

~> **Security Warning:** By default, the chart will install an insecure configuration
of Vault. This provides a less complicated out-of-box experience for new users,
but is not appropriate for a production setup. It is highly recommended to use
a [properly secured Kubernetes cluster](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/securing-a-cluster/).
See the [architecture reference](/docs/platform/k8s/helm/run#architecture)
for a Vault Helm production deployment checklist.

## Using the Helm Chart

To use the Helm chart, you must download or clone the
[vault-helm GitHub repository](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault-helm)
and run Helm against the directory. We plan to transition to using a real
Helm repository soon. When running Helm, we highly recommend you always
checkout a specific tagged release of the chart to avoid any
instabilities from master.

Prior to this, you must have Helm installed and configured both in your
Kubernetes cluster and locally on your machine. The steps to do this are
out of the scope of this document. Please refer to the
[Helm documentation](https://helm.sh/) for more information.

Example chart usage:

```sh
# Clone the chart repo
$ git clone https://github.com/hashicorp/vault-helm.git
$ cd vault-helm

# Checkout a tagged version
$ git checkout v0.4.0

# Run Helm
$ helm install vault ./
```
