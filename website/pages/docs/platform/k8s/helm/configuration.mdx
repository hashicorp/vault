# Configuration

~> **Important Note:** This chart is not compatible with Helm 2. Please use Helm 3 with this chart.

The chart is highly customizable using
[Helm configuration values](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/using_helm/#customizing-the-chart-before-installing).
Each value has a default tuned for an optimal getting started experience
with Vault. Before going into production, please review the parameters below
and consider if they're appropriate for your deployment.

- `global` - These global values affect multiple components of the chart.

  - `enabled` (`boolean: true`) - The master enabled/disabled configuration. If this is true, most components will be installed by default. If this is false, no components will be installed by default and manually opting-in is required, such as by setting `server.enabled` to true.

  - `imagePullSecrets` (`array: []`) - References secrets to be used when pulling images from private registries. See [Pull an Image from a Private Registry](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/pull-image-private-registry/) for more details.

    - `name`: (`string: required`) - Name of the secret containing files required for authentication to private image registries.

  - `tlsDisable` (`boolean: true`) - When set to `true`, changes URLs from `https` to `http` (such as the `VAULT_ADDR=http://127.0.0.1:8200` environment variable set on the Vault pods).

  - `openshift` (`boolean: false`) - If `true`, enables configuration specific to OpenShift such as NetworkPolicy, SecurityContext, and Route.

  - `psp` - Values that configure Pod Security Policy.

    - `enable` (`boolean: false`) - When set to `true`, enables Pod Security Policies for Vault and Vault Agent Injector.

    - `annotations` (`dictionary: {}`) - This value defines additional annotations to
      add to the Pod Security Policies. This can either be YAML or a YAML-formatted
      multi-line templated string.

      ```yaml
      annotations:
        seccomp.security.alpha.kubernetes.io/allowedProfileNames: docker/default,runtime/default
        apparmor.security.beta.kubernetes.io/allowedProfileNames: runtime/default
        seccomp.security.alpha.kubernetes.io/defaultProfileName:  runtime/default
        apparmor.security.beta.kubernetes.io/defaultProfileName:  runtime/default
      # or
      annotations: |
        seccomp.security.alpha.kubernetes.io/allowedProfileNames: docker/default,runtime/default
        apparmor.security.beta.kubernetes.io/allowedProfileNames: runtime/default
        seccomp.security.alpha.kubernetes.io/defaultProfileName:  runtime/default
        apparmor.security.beta.kubernetes.io/defaultProfileName:  runtime/default
      ```

- `injector` - Values that configure running a Vault Agent Injector Admission Webhook Controller within Kubernetes.

  - `enabled` (`boolean: true`) - When set to `true`, the Vault Agent Injector Admission Webhook controller will be created.

  - `externalVaultAddr` (`string: ""`) - External vault server address for the injector to use. Setting this will disable deployment of the vault server, and only deploy the injector.
    A service account with token review permissions is automatically created if `server.serviceAccount.create=true` is set for the external Vault server to use.

  - `image` - Values that configure the Vault Agent Injector Docker image.

    - `repository` (`string: "hashicorp/vault-k8s"`) - The name of the Docker image for Vault Agent Injector.

    - `tag` (`string: "0.6.0"`) - The tag of the Docker image for the Vault Agent Injector. **This should be pinned to a specific version when running in production.** Otherwise, other changes to the chart may inadvertently upgrade your admission controller.

    - `pullPolicy` (`string: "IfNotPresent"`) - The pull policy for container images. The default pull policy is `IfNotPresent` which causes the Kubelet to skip pulling an image if it already exists.

  - `agentImage` - Values that configure the Vault Agent sidecar image.

    - `repository` (`string: "vault"`) - The name of the Docker image for the Vault Agent sidecar. This should be set to the official Vault Docker image.

    - `tag` (`string: "1.5.4"`) - The tag of the Vault Docker image to use for the Vault Agent Sidecar. **Vault 1.3.1+ is required by the admission controller**.

  - `metrics` - Values that configure the Vault Agent Injector metric exporter.

    - `enabled` (`boolean: false`) - When set to `true`, the Vault Agent Injector exports Prometheus metrics at the `/metrics` path.

  - `authPath` (`string: "auth/kubernetes"`) - Mount path of the Vault Kubernetes Auth Method.

  - `revokeOnShutdown` (`boolean: false`) - Configures all Vault Agent sidecars to revoke their token when shutting down.

  - `resources` (`dictionary: {}`) - The resource requests and limits (CPU, memory, etc.) for each container of the server. This should be a YAML dictionary of a Kubernetes [ResourceRequirements](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubernetes-api/v1.15/#resourcerequirements-v1-core) object. If this isn't specified, then the pods won't request any specific amount of resources, which limits the ability for Kubernetes to make efficient use of compute resources.<br /> **Setting this is highly recommended.**

    ```yaml
    resources:
      requests:
        memory: "10Gi"
      limits:
        memory: "10Gi"
    ```

  - `namespaceSelector` (`dictionary: {}`) - The selector used by the admission webhook controller to limit what namespaces where injection can happen. If set to null, all non-system namespaces are eligible for injection.

    ```yaml
    # Selectors are defined as a YAML dictionary.
    # In this example, all namespaces with the label "injection: enabled" are eligible:
    namespaceSelector:
      matchLabels:
        injection: enabled
    ```

  - `certs` - The certs section configures how the webhook TLS certs are configured. These are the TLS certs for the Kube apiserver communicating to the webhook. By default, the injector will generate and manage its own certs, but this requires the ability for the injector to update its own `MutatingWebhookConfiguration`. In a production environment, custom certs should probably be used. Configure the values below to enable this.

    - `secretName` (`string: ""`) - secretName is the name of the Kubernetes secret that has the TLS certificate and private key to serve the injector webhook. If this is null, then the injector will default to its automatic management mode.

    - `caBundle` (`string: ""`) - The PEM-encoded CA public certificate bundle for the TLS certificate served by the injector. This must be specified as a string and can't come from a secret because it must be statically configured on the Kubernetes `MutatingAdmissionWebhook` resource. This only needs to be specified if `secretName` is not null.

    - `certName` (`string: "tls.crt"`) - The name of the certificate file within the `secretName` secret.

    - `keyName` (`string: "tls.key"`) - The name of the key file within the `secretName` secret.

  - `extraEnvironmentVars` (`dictionary: {}`) - Extra environment variables to set in the injector deployment.

  - `affinity` (`string: null`) - Affinity Settings for injector pods. This should be a multi-line string matching the affinity section of a PodSpec.

  - `tolerations` (`string: null`) - Toleration Settings for injector pods. This should be a multi-line string matching the Toleration array in a PodSpec.

  - `nodeSelector` (`string: null`) - nodeSelector labels for injector pod assignment, formatted as a muli-line string.

  - `priorityClassName` (`string: ""`) - Priority class for injector pods

  - `annotations` (`dictionary: {}`) - This value defines additional annotations for injector pods. This can either be YAML or a YAML-formatted multi-line templated string.

    ```yaml

      "sample/annotation1": "foo"
      "sample/annotation2": "bar"
    # or
    annotations: |
      "sample/annotation1": "foo"
      "sample/annotation2": "bar"
    ```

  - `failurePolicy` (`string : ""`) - When set to `Fail`, an error calling the webhook causes the admission to fail and the API request to be rejected.
    When set to `Ignore`, an error calling the webhook is ignored and the API request is allowed to continue. Allowed values: `Fail`, `Ignore`.

- `server` - Values that configure running a Vault server within Kubernetes.

  - `image` - Values that configure the Vault Docker image.

    - `repository` (`string: "vault"`) - The name of the Docker image for the containers running Vault.

    - `tag` (`string: "1.5.4"`) - The tag of the Docker image for the containers running Vault. **This should be pinned to a specific version when running in production.** Otherwise, other changes to the chart may inadvertently upgrade your admission controller.

    - `pullPolicy` (`string: "IfNotPresent"`) - The pull policy for container images. The default pull policy is `IfNotPresent` which causes the Kubelet to skip pulling an image if it already exists.

    - `updateStrategyType` (`string: "OnDelete"`) - Configure the [Update Strategy Type](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/statefulset/#update-strategies) for the StatefulSet.

    - `resources` (`dictionary: {}`) - The resource requests and limits (CPU, memory, etc.) for each container of the server. This should be a YAML dictionary of a Kubernetes [ResourceRequirements](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubernetes-api/v1.15/#resourcerequirements-v1-core) object. If this isn't specified, then the pods won't request any specific amount of resources, which limits the ability for Kubernetes to make efficient use of compute resources. **Setting this is highly recommended.**

      ```yaml
      resources:
        requests:
          memory: "10Gi"
        limits:
          memory: "10Gi"
      ```

      ```

    - `affinity` - This value defines the [affinity](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/assign-pod-node/#affinity-and-anti-affinity) for server pods. It defaults to allowing only a single pod on each node, which minimizes risk of the cluster becoming unusable if a node is lost. If you need to run more pods per node (for example, testing on Minikube), set this value to `null`.

    ```yaml
    # Recommended default server affinity:
    affinity: |
      podAntiAffinity:
        requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:

Headless services can be used to communicate with pods directly through DNS instead of a round robin load balancer.

      - `type` (`string: "ClusterIP"`) - Sets the type of service to create, such as `NodePort`.

      - `port` (`int: 8200`) - Port on which Vault server is listening inside the pod.

      - `size` (`string: 10Gi`) -
        Size of the volume to be created for Vault's audit logs.

      - `storageClass` (`string: null`) -
        Name of the storage class to use when creating the audit storage volume.

      - `mountPath` (`string: /vault/audit`) -
        Configures the path in the Vault pod where the audit storage will be mounted.

      - `accessMode` (`string: ReadWriteOnce`) -
        Type of access mode of the storage device.

      - `annotations` (`dictionary: {}`) - This value defines additional annotations to
      add to the audit PVCs. This can either be YAML or a YAML-formatted
      multi-line templated string.

      ```yaml
      annotations:
        kubernetes.io/my-pvc: foobar
      # or
      annotations: |
        kubernetes.io/my-pvc: foobar
      ```

    - `dev` - This configures `dev` mode for the Vault server.

      - `enabled` (`boolean: false`) -
        Enables `dev` mode for the Vault server. This mode is useful for experimenting with Vault without needing to unseal.

      ~> **Security Warning:** Never, ever, ever run a "dev" mode server in production. It is insecure and will lose data on every restart (since it stores data in-memory). It is only made for development or experimentation.

    - `standalone` - This configures `standalone` mode for the Vault server.

      - `enabled` (`boolean: true`) -
        Enables `standalone` mode for the Vault server. This mode uses the `file` storage backend and requires a volume for persistence (`dataStorage`).

      - `config` (`string: "{}"`) -
        A raw string of extra HCL or JSON [configuration](/docs/configuration) for Vault servers.
        This will be saved as-is into a ConfigMap that is read by the Vault servers.
        This can be used to add additional configuration that isn't directly exposed by the chart.

      ```yaml
      # ExtraConfig values are formatted as a multi-line string:
      config: |
        api_addr = "http://POD_IP:8200"

        listener "tcp" {
          tls_disable = 1
          address     = "0.0.0.0:8200"
        }

        storage "file" {
          path = "/vault/data"
        }
      ```

      This can also be set using Helm's `--set` flag (vault-helm v0.1.0 and later), using the following syntax:

      ```shell
      --set server.standalone.config='{ listener "tcp" { address = "0.0.0.0:8200" }'
      ```

    - `ha` - This configures `ha` mode for the Vault server.

      - `enabled` (`boolean: false`) -
        Enables `ha` mode for the Vault server. This mode uses a highly available backend storage (such as Consul) to store Vault's data. By default this is configured to use [Consul Helm](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul-helm). For a complete list of storage backends, see the [Vault documentation](/docs/configuration).

      - `apiAddr`: (`string: "{}"`) -
        Set the API address configuration for a Vault cluster.  If set to an empty string, the pod IP address is used.

      - `raft` - This configures `raft` integrated storage mode for the Vault server.

        - `enabled` (`boolean: false`) -
          Enables `raft` integrated storage mode for the Vault server. This mode uses persistent volumes for storage.

        - `setNodeId` (`boolean: false`) - Set the Node Raft ID to the name of the pod.

        - `config` (`string: "{}"`) -
          A raw string of extra HCL or JSON [configuration](/docs/configuration) for Vault servers.
          This will be saved as-is into a ConfigMap that is read by the Vault servers.
          This can be used to add additional configuration that isn't directly exposed by the chart.

      - `replicas` (`int: 5`) -
        The number of pods to deploy to create a highly available cluster of Vault servers.

      - `updatePartition` (`int: 0`) -
        If an updatePartition is specified, all Pods with an ordinal that is greater than or equal to the partition will be updated when the StatefulSet’s `.spec.template` is updated. If set to `0`, this disables partition updates. For more information see the [official Kubernetes documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/statefulset/#rolling-updates).

      - `config` (`string: "{}"`) -
        A raw string of extra HCL or JSON [configuration](/docs/configuration) for Vault servers.
        This will be saved as-is into a ConfigMap that is read by the Vault servers.
        This can be used to add additional configuration that isn't directly exposed by the chart.

      ```yaml
      # ExtraConfig values are formatted as a multi-line string:
      config: |
        ui = true
        api_addr = "http://POD_IP:8200"
        listener "tcp" {
            tls_disable = 1
            address     = "0.0.0.0:8200"
        }

        storage "consul" {
            path = "vault"
            address = "HOST_IP:8500"
        }
      ```

      This can also be set using Helm's `--set` flag (vault-helm v0.1.0 and later), using the following syntax:

      ```shell
      --set server.ha.config='{ listener "tcp" { address = "0.0.0.0:8200" }'
      ```

    * `disruptionBudget` - Values that configures the disruption budget policy. See the [official Kubernetes documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/run-application/configure-pdb/) for more information.

      - `enabled` (`boolean: true`) -
        Enables disruption budget policy to limit the number of pods that are down simultaneously from voluntary disruptions.

      - `maxUnavailable` (`int: null`) -
        The maximum number of unavailable pods. By default, this will be automatically
        computed based on the `server.replicas` value to be `(n/2)-1`. If you need to set
        this to `0`, you will need to add a `--set 'server.disruptionBudget.maxUnavailable=0'`
        flag to the helm chart installation command because of a limitation in the Helm
        templating language.

  - `statefulset` - This configures settings for the Vault Statefulset.

    - `annotations` (`dictionary: {}`) - This value defines additional annotations to
      add to the Vault statefulset. This can either be YAML or a YAML-formatted
      multi-line templated string.

      ```yaml
      annotations:
        kubernetes.io/my-statefulset: foobar
      # or
      annotations: |
        kubernetes.io/my-statefulset: foobar
      ```


- `ui` - Values that configure the Vault UI.

  - `enabled` (`boolean: false`) - If true, the UI will be enabled. The UI will only be enabled on Vault servers. If `server.enabled` is false, then this setting has no effect. To expose the UI in some way, you must configure `ui.service`.

  - `serviceType` (`string: ClusterIP`) -
    The service type to register. This defaults to `ClusterIP`.
    The available service types are documented on
    [the Kubernetes website](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#publishing-services-service-types).

  - `publishNotReadyAddresses` (`boolean: true`) -
    If set to true, will route traffic to Vault pods that aren't ready (if they're sealed or uninitialized.

  - `activeVaultPodOnly` (`boolean: false`) -
    If set to true, the UI service will only route to the active pod in a Vault HA cluster.

  - `serviceNodePort` (`int: null`) -
    Sets the Node Port value when using `serviceType: NodePort` on the Vault UI service.

  - `externalPort` (`int: 8200`) -
    Sets the external port value of the service.

  - `loadBalancerSourceRanges` (`string`) - This value defines additional source CIDRs when using `serviceType: LoadBalancer`. This should be formatted as a multi-line string.

  ```yaml
  loadBalancerSourceRanges:
    - 10.0.0.0/16
    - 120.78.23.3/32
  ```

  - `loadBalancerIP` (`string`) - This value defines the IP address of the load balancer when using `serviceType: LoadBalancer`.

  - `annotations` (`dictionary: {}`) - This value defines additional annotations for the UI service. This can either be YAML or a YAML-formatted multi-line templated string.

  ```yaml
  annotations:
    "sample/annotation1": "foo"
    "sample/annotation2": "bar"
  # or
  annotations: |
    "sample/annotation1": "foo"
    "sample/annotation2": "bar"
  ```
