scenario "dev_single_cluster" {
  description = <<-EOF
    This scenario spins up a single Vault cluster with either an external Consul cluster or
    integrated Raft for storage. None of our test verification is included in this scenario in order
    to improve end-to-end speed. If you wish to perform such verification you'll need to use a
    non-dev scenario instead.

    The scenario supports finding and installing any released 'linux/amd64' or 'linux/arm64' Vault
    artifact as long as its version is >= 1.8. You can also use the 'artifact:local' variant to
    build and deploy the current branch!

    In order to execute this scenario you'll need to install the enos CLI:
      brew tap hashicorp/tap && brew update && brew install hashicorp/tap/enos

    You'll also need access to an AWS account with an SSH keypair.
    Perform the steps here to get AWS access with Doormat https://eng-handbook.hashicorp.services/internal-tools/enos/common-setup-steps/#authenticate-with-doormat
    Perform the steps here to get an AWS keypair set up: https://eng-handbook.hashicorp.services/internal-tools/enos/common-setup-steps/#set-your-aws-key-pair-name-and-private-key

    Please note that this scenario requires several inputs variables to be set in order to function
    properly. While not all variants will require all variables, it's suggested that you look over
    the scenario outline to determine which variables affect which steps and which have inputs that
    you should set. You can use the following command to get a textual outline of the entire
    scenario:
      enos scenario outline dev_single_cluster

    You can also create an HTML version that is suitable for viewing in web browsers:
      enos scenario outline dev_single_cluster --format html > index.html
      open index.html

    To configure the required variables you have a couple of choices. You can create an
    'enos-local.vars' file in the same 'enos' directory where this scenario is defined. In it you
    declare your desired variable values. For example, you could copy the following content and
    then set the values as necessary:

    artifactory_username      = "username@hashicorp.com"
    artifactory_token         = "<ARTIFACTORY TOKEN VALUE>
    aws_region                = "us-west-2"
    aws_ssh_keypair_name      = "<YOUR REGION SPECIFIC KEYPAIR NAME>"
    aws_ssh_keypair_key_path  = "/path/to/your/private/key.pem"
    dev_build_local_ui        = false
    dev_consul_version        = "1.18.1"
    vault_license_path        = "./support/vault.hclic"
    vault_product_version     = "1.16.2"

    Alternatively, you can set them in your environment:
    export ENOS_VAR_aws_region="us-west-2"
    export ENOS_VAR_vault_license_path="./support/vault.hclic"

    After you've configured your inputs you can list and filter the available scenarios and then
    subsequently launch and destroy them.
      enos scenario list --help
      enos scenario launch --help
      enos scenario list dev_single_cluster
      enos scenario launch dev_single_cluster arch:arm64 artifact:local backend:raft distro:ubuntu edition:ce seal:awskms

    When the scenario is finished launching you refer to the scenario outputs to see information
    related to your cluster. You can use this information to SSH into nodes and/or to interact
    with vault.
      enos scenario output dev_single_cluster arch:arm64 artifact:local backend:raft distro:ubuntu edition:ce seal:awskms
      ssh -i /path/to/your/private/key.pem <PUBLIC_IP>
      vault status

    After you've finished you can tear down the cluster
      enos scenario destroy dev_single_cluster arch:arm64 artifact:local backend:raft distro:ubuntu edition:ce seal:awskms
