# The SLES AMI's do not come configured with Zypper repositories by default. To get them you
# have to run SUSEConnect to register the instance with SUSE. On the AMI this is handled
# automatically by a oneshot systemd unit called guestregister.service. This oneshot service needs
# to complete before any other repo or package steps are completed. At the time of writing it's very
# unreliable so we have to ensure that it has correctly executed ourselves or restart it. We do this
# by checking if the guestregister.service has reached the correct "inactive" state that we need.
# If it hasn't reached that state it's usually in some sort of active state, i.e. running, or it has
# failed. If it's in one of the active states we need to let it continue and check the status when
# it completes. If it has completed but is failed we'll restart the service to re-run the script that
# executes SUSEConnect.
