vault.cluster.secrets.mount.index here is where we need to show the list of mounts from the plugin/catelog endpoint we
should. use a component, but we're testing
<form>
  {{#each this.model as |mount|}}
    <div>
      {{get (engines-display-data mount) "displayName"}}
    </div>
  {{/each}}
</form>
