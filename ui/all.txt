[vault] WARNING! dev mode is enabled! In this mode, Vault runs entirely in-memory
[vault] and starts unsealed with a single unseal key. The root token is already
[vault] authenticated to the CLI, so you can immediately begin using Vault.
[vault] 
[vault] You may need to set the following environment variables:
[vault] 
[vault]     $ export VAULT_ADDR='http://127.0.0.1:9200'
[vault] 
[vault] The unseal key and root token are displayed below in case you want to
[vault] seal/unseal the Vault or re-authenticate.

[vault] Unseal Key: 7xxlmxyp7m4sW0ecZtyoGNvvnR/qNmgiVdlJ/rwARGg=
[vault] Root Token: root
