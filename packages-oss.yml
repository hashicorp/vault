# packages.yml
#
# packages.yml defines all the packages we are able to build for a single commit
# in this repo. A package means a single zip file containing the executable binary,
# and optionally other files if needed.
#
# packages.yml is a convenience file for the human management of large numbers of
# alternate packages, allowing default and templated values. We generate another
# artifact from this one, called packages.lock which contains the fully expanded set
# of package and layer specs. This fully expanded file is in turn used to drive the
# build process, and as data for templating CI config.

# config contains packagespec config for this repo.
config:
  # product-repo is important to CI providers.
  product-repo:          git@github.com:hashicorp/vault.git
  release-repo:          git@github.com:hashicorp/vault-release.git
  # product-id is used by external systems to identify this product.
  # It can be any unique name, but a golang import path is ideal.

# inputs are a set of environment variables that may affect the set of bytes produced
# for a given package. Note that a package is a zip file containing the binary, so
# the name of the binary does affect the package's bytes.
inputs:

  # defaults contains default input values for each package.
  # These values may be overridden on a per-package basis in the packages section.
  defaults:

    # PRODUCT_VERSION is the version of this product. Usually, this should be left
    # as 0.0.0-snapshot. When we build a release candidate, this is overridden in
    # a one-off fashion to produce that build.
    # This should be used in the PACKAGE_NAME template.
    PRODUCT_VERSION: 0.0.0-snapshot

    # GO_VERSION is the version of the Go toolchain to use to compile this package.
    GO_VERSION: 1.14.7

    # YARN_VERSION is the version of Yarn to install for the UI layer.
    YARN_VERSION: 1.19.1-1

    # Standard golang environment variables, passed to the 'go build' command.
    # You can use any standard environment variables here, any that you omit
    # will be ommitted from the go build command too, meaning to use the system
    # default in the build container.
    CGO_ENABLED: 0
    GO111MODULE: "off"

  # templates contain golang template strings. Each of these is rendered per package
  # using that packages values (including any default values), and then added to that
  # package.
  # Note that templates MAY NOT refer to each other, but may refer to any default or
  # package-specific inputs.
  templates:

    # BINARY_NAME is the name of the executable binary we compile and package.
    # It is the name users will use on the CLI to invoke the product.
    BINARY_NAME: 'vault{{if eq .GOOS "windows"}}.exe{{end}}'

    # PRODUCT_VERSION_MMP is just the major.minor.prerelease fields of the PRODUCT_VERSION.
    # Think semantic versioning (semver), although we do not version our binaries
    # using semver.
    PRODUCT_VERSION_MMP: >-

# build-command is a templated bash script to be run in the final builder container
# to produce the package. It may refer to any of the inputs, including rendered templates,
# but not meta data.
#
# The build command is passed 3 environment variables, in addition to all those specified as inputs.
#
#   - PACKAGE_SOURCE_ID       The source ID (usually the git commit SHA, unless build is dirty)
#   - OUTPUT_DIR              Directory to write the executable and zip file to (will exist already)
#   - PACKAGE_ZIP_NAME        The name of the package zip file to create (relative to OUTPUT_DIR)
#
# NOTE: You MUST NOT use single quotes in the build command, because at present we do no escaping.

# packages is the full set of packages we are able to build based on a single commit
# in this repo. Each package is a map where the keys are the names of environment
# variables provided to each build (think 'go build' invocation). Each package is
# expanded by first filling in any unspecified variables with those from defaults,
# and then rendering each template and adding the result to the map.
# Each package must result in a unique PACKAGE_NAME.
#
# The fully expanded set of packages are written to packages.lock. That file
# is a useful data source for building CI/CD pipelines.

# Layers determines the build layers, which are individually cacheable layers
# in a linear build. Each layer contains a Dockerfile. All the layers
# together produce the final builder image used to compile binaries.
#
# The partial Dockerfiles may contain references to any of the inputs
# including rendered input templates, but may not reference meta data.
# These Dockerfiles, once rendered, count as inputs and affect the
# package spec ID of each package.
#
# The order of layers is significant. The first layer must have a FROM line, and
# forms the base image. Each subsequent layer begins from the previous one.
#
# You can control cacheability by careful use of variables and ordering.
# Try to group things which change infrequently towards the top, and
# things which change more frequently towards the bottom.
#
# If there are things you want to cache that vary between packages defined in
# this file, put them last so that the greater bulk of work can be shared.
#
# NOTE: At present, changing the names and/or adding/removing layers may
# require updating the CI template file at .circleci/config/@build-release.yml.tpl
# which references some of these layers by name.
