name: Add HashiCorp contributed label

# The purpose of this job is to label all HashiCorp contributed PRs, so that
# we can more easily identify community contributed PRs (anything that doesn't
# have this label).
# While it might seem like this is the 'reverse' of what we should do, GitHub
# (rightly) does not allow branches from forks to have write permissions, so
# making PRs from forks self-label themselves as community-contributed is not
# possible.
