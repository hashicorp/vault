# Some words of caution before modifying this workflow:

# This file and workflow have been carefully architected to meet the following requirements:
#   * Builds and tests the correct artifacts in both CE and Ent while maintaining a merge-conflict-free
#     build.yml between the two repos
#   * Supports multiple Github event triggers
#   * Is highly optimized for cost and speed
#   * Supports a variety of complex use cases

# If you wish to modify this file/workflow, please consider:
#   * That the workflow must work under when triggered by pull_request, push, schedule, and
#     workflow_dispatch events.
#   * Merge-conflict-free compatibility between CE and Ent. Any changes that you make here must work
#     in both repository contexts.
#   * There are many workflow flow control modifiers. Further details below.
#   * The total number of workers and the runner size. Further details below.

# Further details:
#   * The workflow is used by the CRT system for building, notarizing, signing, and releasing
#     artifacts. Whatever we do in this workflow must support building all artifacts and uploading
#     them to Github in order to fulfill the CRT requirement, while also maintaining a smaller
#     default build matrix for the pull requests.
#   * CRT is designed to trigger a workflow called build in a workflow file called build.yml. This
#     file must build the correct artifacts in CE and Ent, depending on the repository context.
#     We've gone to great lengths to architect this file and workflow so that we can build and test
#     the correct artifacts in each context while maintaining a merge-conflict-free file between CE
#     and Ent. Any changes that you make here must work in both repository contexts.
#   * The workflow must support multiple event triggers, all of which have varying event payloads
#     which must be considered. If you make changes you must ensure that the workflow still works
#     under normal pull_request, push, schedule, and workflow_dispatch trigger events.
#   * The workflow has been highly optimized for cost and speed. If possible, it's better to add a
#     step to an existing job than create another job. Over a long time horizon a new job is often
#     much more expensive than a single step in an existing job, they also take up a limited number
#     of our available runners.
#   * Flow control in the workflow is complex in order to support many various use cases, including:
#     * Only building on tier 1 supported "core" artifacts by default.
#     * Only building the UI if the Go application or UI has been modified.
#     * Skipping builds entirely if the commit or PR only modifies changelog or website documentation.
#     * The ability to check out the HEAD reference instead of a Github merge branch reference.
#     * The ability to control building all of our tier 2 supported "extended" artifacts via a
#       build/all label, even if the event trigger is pull_request or, more importantly, a push.
#       It's important to note that we must maintain support for building all artifacts on push
#       via a pull request, even though push events aren't directly tied to pull requests. Our
#       label metadata helpers are designed to handle this complexity.
#     * The ability to build all of our artifacts on a scheduled cadence to ensure we don't
#       accidentally regress.
#     * All of these considerations, and many others, have led to the modular design we have here.
#     * If you're doing something in more than one place, try and use small composite actions
#       whenever possible.
