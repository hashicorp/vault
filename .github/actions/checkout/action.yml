        # Determine our desired checkout ref and fetch depth. Depending our our workflow event
        # trigger, inputs, and tags, we'll check out different references at different depths.
        #
        # * If the trigger event is a pull request we will default to a magical merge SHA that Github
        #   creates. Essentially, this SHA is the product of merging our PR into the merge target
        #   branch at some point in time. When you push a change to a PR branch Github updates this
        #   branch if it can.
        # * If the trigger event is a pull request and a `checkout-head` tag is present or the
        #   checkout-head input is set, we'll use HEAD of the PR branch instead of the magical
        #   merge SHA.
        # * If the trigger event is a push (merge) then we'll get the latest commit that was pushed.
        # * For anything any other event type we'll default to whatever is default in Github.
        #
        # Our fetch depth will varies depending on what our chosen SHA is. We normally want to do
        # the most shallow clone possible for speed, but we also need to support getting history
        # for determining what files have changed, etc. We'll always check out one level deep for
        # merges or standard pull requests. If checking out HEAD is requested we'll fetch a deeper
        # history because we need all commits on the branch.
