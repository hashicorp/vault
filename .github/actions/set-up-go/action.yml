        # painfully unbalanced Go test execution times. We have to ensure current caches for all
        # active release branches and main do not exceed 10gb. Ideally we'd cache Go modules
        # and Go build cache on a per version/platform/architecture/tag/module basis, but that
        # would result in several hungred gb over all of our build workflows and release branches.
        # Instead, we've chosen a middle ground approach where were share Go modules between build
        # workflows but lose the Go build cache.
        # We intentionally do not use partial restore keys. If we get dont get an exact cache hit
        # we only want to download the latest modules, not append them to a prior cache. This
        # keeps cache upload time, download time, and storage size to a minimum.
