* core: Bump Go version to 1.23.8

BUG FIXES:

* secrets/openldap: Prevent static role rotation on upgrade when `NextVaultRotation` is nil.

### April 4, 2025

**Enterprise LTS:** Vault Enterprise 1.16 is a [Long-Term Support (LTS)](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/docs/enterprise/lts) release.

CHANGES:

* auth/azure: Update plugin to v0.17.3. Login requires `resource_group_name`, `vm_name`, and `vmss_name` to match token claims.

IMPROVEMENTS:

* core (enterprise): report errors from the underlying seal when getting entropy.

BUG FIXES:

* auth/ldap: Fix a bug that does not properly delete users and groups by first converting their names to lowercase when case senstivity option is off. [[GH-29922](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/pull/29922)]
* core: Fix Azure authentication for seal/managed keys to work for both federated workload identity and managed user identities.  Fixes regression for federated workload identities. [[GH-29792](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/pull/29792)]
* core: Fix a bug that prevents certain loggers from writing to a log file. [[GH-29917](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/pull/29917)]
* export API: Normalize the start_date parameter to the start of the month as is done in the sys/counters API to keep the results returned from both of the API's consistent. [[GH-29562](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/pull/29562)]
* plugins (enterprise): Fix plugin registration with artifact when a binary for the same plugin is already present in the plugin directory.
* plugins: plugin registration should honor the `plugin_tmpdir` config [[GH-29978](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/pull/29978)]
* secrets/azure: Upgrade plugin to v0.17.4 which reverts role name changes to no longer be a GUID.

### March 5, 2025

**Enterprise LTS:** Vault Enterprise 1.16 is a [Long-Term Support (LTS)](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/docs/enterprise/lts) release.

BUG FIXES:

* core: Fix Azure authentication for seal/managed keys to work for both federated workload identity and managed user identities.  Fixes regression for federated workload identities. [[GH-29792](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/pull/29792)]

## 1.16.16 Enterprise
### February 25, 2025

**Enterprise LTS:** Vault Enterprise 1.16 is a [Long-Term Support (LTS)](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/docs/enterprise/lts) release.

SECURITY:

* raft/snapshotagent (enterprise): upgrade raft-snapshotagent to v0.2.0

CHANGES:

* build: Drop `netbsd/386` and `netbsd/arm` builds as downstream modules no longer support them.
* core: Bump Go version to 1.23.6.
* raft/autopilot (enterprise): Alongside the CE autopilot update, update raft-autopilot-enterprise library to v0.3.0 and add enterprise-specific regression testing.
* secrets/openldap: Update plugin to v0.12.4

FEATURES:

* **Plugins**: Allow Enterprise plugins to run externally on Vault Enterprise only.

IMPROVEMENTS:

* raft/autopilot: We've updated the autopilot reconciliation logic (by updating the raft-autopilot dependency to v0.3.0) to avoid artificially increasing the quorum in presence of an unhealthy node. Now autopilot will start the reconciliation process by attempting to demote a failed voter node before any promotions, fixing the issue where Vault would initially increase quorum when faced with a failure of a voter node. In certain configurations, especially when using Vault Enterprise Redundancy Zones and losing a voter then a non-voter in quick succession, this would lead to a loss of quorum and cluster failure. [[GH-29306](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/pull/29306)]

BUG FIXES:

* activity: Show activity records from clients created in deleted namespaces when activity log is queried from admin namespace. [[GH-29432](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/pull/29432)]
* core/managed-keys (enterprise): Allow mechanism numbers above 32 bits in PKCS#11 managed keys.
* core: Fix bug when if failing to persist the barrier keyring to track encryption counts, the number of outstanding encryptions remains added to the count, overcounting encryptions. [[GH-29506](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/pull/29506)]
* secrets-sync (enterprise): Add new parameters for destination configs to specify allowlists for IP's and ports.
* secrets/pki: fixes issue #28749 requiring all chains to be single line of authority. [[GH-29342](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/pull/29342)]
* ui/database: Fixes 'cannot update static username' error when updating static role's rotation period [[GH-29498](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/pull/29498)]

## 1.16.15 Enterprise

IMPROVEMENTS:

* plugins (enterprise): The Database secrets engine now allows skipping the automatic rotation of static roles during import.

* database/mssql: Fix a bug where contained databases would silently fail root rotation if a custom root rotation statement was not provided. [[GH-29399](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/pull/29399)]
* plugins: Fix a bug that causes zombie dbus-daemon processes on certain systems. [[GH-29334](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/pull/29334)]
* sdk/database: Fix a bug where slow database connections can cause goroutines to be blocked. [[GH-29097](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/pull/29097)]

when querying the activity log endpoints. [[GH-27350](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/pull/27350)]
* core/ha (enterprise): Failed attempts to become a performance standby node are now using an exponential backoff instead of a
10 second delay in between retries. The backoff starts at 2s and increases by a factor of two until reaching
the maximum of 16s. This should make unsealing of the node faster in some cases.
